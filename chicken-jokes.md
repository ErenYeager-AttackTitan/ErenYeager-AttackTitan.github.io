>The plan here is to collect some chicken jokes, inspired by David Morin’s [similar thing with physicists](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/academics/undergrad/chickenroad). I try to answer the age old question of *Why did the chicken cross the road?* from the perspective of different mathematicians.

**John Nash**: Because the chicken always does what is best for the chicken. The chicken does not care for the group.

**Newton**: Because the chicken does not understand what a vector is.

**Pythagoras**: Because the chicken’s angle was not right.

**Fermat**: I know the answer, but this message is too short to write it.

**Ramanujan**: I don’t know. The chicken is finite. I know infinity.

**Serge Lang**: I leave it as an exercise to the reader.

**Erdös**: Because he wanted to write a joint paper with me.

**Mandelbrot**: The chicken crossed the road because the chicken crossed the road because the chicken crossed the road….

**Alan Turing**: It is an enigma to me.

**C. L. Dodgson**: Alice is also wondering the same.

**Möbius**: She didn’t, she just got back to where she started.

**Penrose**: Because she couldn’t climb the stairs.

**Stephen Hawking**: Because the black hole in the pavement bothered her.
