<p>For this project, you will use the same groups from Project #1, with the change that we will no longer be split into Dev or Ops teams, but rather use the larger 6 person teams to execute the project. The goal of this project is to practice the workflow of social coding â€” learning to collaborate within a group on a common set of data. Each team will deliver a simple website that is hosted on Github.com using the Github Pages service. Github Pages is typically used to host an informational website about a technical project; in this case, there is no technical project behind the website, but you can just write a placeholder file (like a README file) to have something in the master branch, or you can create a group and make an organization page instead.</p>
