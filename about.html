<p style = 'color: grey;'>Hello, I'm Ashutosh!</p>



<p style = 'color: grey;'>Currenlty working as a Senior Data Scientist at HDFC Life with Data Labs (Predictive Modelling team). Majority of my work includes generating actionable business insights through applied machine learning, which involves collecting data from various sources, cleaning, pre-processing, outlier detection, feature engineering, ML algorithm selection, hyper parameter tuning, algorithm training, validation and model deployment for the end users.  </p>

    Previously, I had worked with Flytxt as a Data Scientist, where I developed machine learning solution for clients (Telecom Companies) with
    the application of Applied machine learning and Big data fundamentals (Apache-Spark, HDFS, Distributed Computing).
