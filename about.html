      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Tao and I am looking for <b>data/business</b> analyst position currently. I hold
        a Bechelor's degree in mathematics(Information and Computing Science with data analysis track, Wuhan
        University of Technology) and a Master's degree in science(Business Analytics, University of Exeter)</p>
      <p>Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So that's how I look at data sets: they are
         big puzzles and once they are been solved, you will get rewards in business. Finding secrets nobody else sees 
        is the challenge to me.</p>
      <p>Before I studied my postgradute degree, I had worked for one year as a marketing analyst. I have worked for 5 
        companies and orgnisations which gives me the ability to translate complex questions into understand insights.
      </p> 
      <p>Do you want to work together? Please reach out to me by e-mail below.</p>
      <p>You can find my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RQ3YpILKskgGwy3aMQeCthx_bvWOf3ji/view?usp=sharing">CV</a> here.</p>
