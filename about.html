<p>I am a professionally licensed engineer with eight years of industry experience. Prior to joining Code 4 Canada, I worked in a software startup called SceneDoc, where we delivered a mobile criminal case management system for law enforcement agencies around the world! During my time at SceneDoc, I was able to successfully organically grow the company to the point where we were successfully acquired by Tyler Technologies (NYSE: TYL), the largest publicly traded company in Public Safety. I am now bringing my expertise into the CivicTech world, and I'm excited to bring digital transformation and innovation for the betterment of Canadians at a national level. Always happy to connect via LinkedIn to chat!</p>
