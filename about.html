Yifei Yu is a PhD student at the Department of Industrial Engineering and Business Information Systems (IEBIS), at the University of Twente (UT). The information about his current PhD project can be found in the section of Research. Previously, he obtained his Master's degree in Construction Management and Engineering specialized in digital technology design at the Faculty of Engineering Technology at the UT in 2020. During the master programme, he was admitted as a member of UT Research Honours Programme 2019 because of his excellent track record. Afterwards, he worked as a junior researcher at IEBIS to prepare his own PhD proposal supported by Twente Graduate School (TGS) Bridging Grant for six months.

He conducts multi-disciplinary research about implementing Circular Economy in the construction industry. Particularly, he is interested in innovating Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to develop decision-support instruments for both government bodies and private enterprises regarding circular collaborations. Methodologically, he focuses on the integration of Agent-Based Modelling and Geographic Information Systems, blending with Enterprise Architecture Design. He aims to improve construction resource efficiency and ultimately fosters the development of smart circular construction ecosystems.
