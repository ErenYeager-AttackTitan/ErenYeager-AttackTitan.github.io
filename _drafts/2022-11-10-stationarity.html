<h2 class="section-heading">Background</h2>
<p>Before we jump into looking if our time series are stationary or not. Firsly, we need to understand what it means and why it is important.</p>

<p>According to \parencite{Li2016}, "A time series being stationary means that its joint probability distribution is time-invariant."</p>
<p>In a regression model, the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators are not consistent for non-stationary series and the standard statistical tests are not valid. Additionally, many of statistical tests assume that the data is stationary.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What makes our data non-stationry?</h2>
<p>There are a few options...</p>
