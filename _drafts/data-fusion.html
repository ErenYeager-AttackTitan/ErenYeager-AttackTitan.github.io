<p>
  Data fusion is process used to combine mulitple sensor reading to get more accurate 
  reading. For example, we have a robot move forward and backword. The robot use ladir 
  to measure the obestical and estimate the distance. All sensor they have a noise in their reading 
  and accuracy ( foe example, the ladir the robot use has a std of 2 cm therefore, if the robot read the distance 
  20cm we can say the robot position fall between 18cm and 22cm). The noise in the sensor can be experse as gussain noise. 
  Going back to our robot, if the ladir show the wall is 25cm away from the robot with std 5m as shown in the figure below the green curve.  
</p>

<p>
  We have other reading came from the odometry using encoder and it shows the robot position is at 7m with std 7m.
  If we keep reading both sensor independently, the error in ladiar will stay same while the odometery will increase to the point 
  that cannot be use as reliable. Therfore we use data fusion to combine both reading to get a more accurate reading value. The 
  figure below shows the output of combining both reading. As can be seen that blue curve shows the position at 6m with a std 3m 
  which is much better than each sensor works independently.

<p>
    The process occurs at the top consisting of two steps which are (1) prediction step and (2) update step. 
    In the first step, the dynamic of the robot updates the current state \(x_t\) where the uncertainty grows while 
    the second step updates the current state \(x_t\) and reduces the uncertainty in the system. 
</p>
<p>
    The fusion process can be done by Bayes' Theorem using different probability distributions or we can use the Kalman filter.
</p>
<p>
    The Kalman filter considers a robust mathematical model used in data fusion where it simplifies the problem. 
    The Kalman filter solve linear systems \( \hat x = f(x | z_1, .... z_n )\), where \(\hat x\) is the estimated state, \(x\) 
    is the uncertain state and \(z_1 , z_n \) is the noisy measured state. So the Kalman filter minimise the state using 
    the noizy measurment to get as close as possible to the accurate state \(\hat x = min J\). Therefore, the problem convert 
    to minimizing the error between the noizy state and the estimated state \(\overline x = x - \hat x \) , 
    where  \(\overline x \) is the state estimation error. We have the state estimation Covariance \(P = [(x- \hat x)(x- \hat x)^T]\) 
    and the cost function Jacobian \( J= [(x- \hat x)^T(x- \hat x)] = Tr(P) \). 
    Therefore, we can minimise the cost function \(J\).
</p>

<p>
    There are differently typed Kalman filters (KF) due to the computation efficiency. 
    However, due to the Kalman filter process, only linear equations and Extended Kalman filter 
    (EKF) was designed to work on a non-linear model by approximating the model to linearize the 
    relationship and use a linear Covariance. 
    Therefore, EKF works with models that can linearize.
    Since some models cannot approximate a linear model, an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) 
    developed to work with non-linear models to calculate the prediction and updated equations. 
    The UKF linearize the uncertainty Covariance instead of linearizing the models' dynamics.

<h2 class="subsection-heading">An implementation of KF in arduino</h2>

<p>
    Now I am going to implement KF in Arduino to provide me with a more accurate data reading of 
    IMU sensor (MUP-6050). We will correct one roll angle of the sensor using Kalman gain. 
    Kalman gain uses to update the measure state in order to correct the new estimate state. 
</p>
$$
  K = \frac {P*H} {H*P*H+R}
$$
<p>
  where \(P\) is error covariance, \(H\) measure map scalar, \(Q\) initial estimation covariance, and 
  \(R\) is noise coverance. The Kalman gain should be between 0 and 1, which refer to the stabiltity of the system, 
  0 is stable estimate and 1 is unstable estimate.
</p>
<p>
    The class below is the Kalman filter algorithms for a singel input state. 
    The class define multiple virables which define in the function to compute the kalman gain. 
    The update function is used to compute the updated kalman gain and the corrected state.
</p>


{% highlight ruby %}
class Kalamn_filter
{
  public:
    const float R = 20;   // noise coverance
    const float H = 1.00;  // measure map scalar
    float Q = 2;           // initial estimation covariance
    float P = 0;           //error covariance
    float x_hat = 0;       // updated state
    float K = 0; //kalman gain;
  float Update(int x)
    {
    
    K = P*H/(H*P*H+R); // update kalman gain
    x_hat = x_hat + K*(x-H*x_hat);

    // update error covariance 
    P= (1-K*H)*P+Q;

    return x_hat;
    }
};
};
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    The blow code is the setup and main function loop where we define the Serial and we initialize the sensor 
    and the kalman filter class. In the main loop we get the data from the snesor and pass it to the update function 
    to calculate the estimated state.
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
Kalamn_filter kalman_filter();
void setup() {
    // put your setup code here, to run once:
      Serial.begin(9600);
  
    Serial.println("Initialize MPU6050");
  
    while(!mpu.begin(MPU6050_SCALE_2000DPS, MPU6050_RANGE_2G))
    {
      Serial.println("Could not find a valid MPU6050 sensor, check wiring!");
      delay(500);
    }
  
    // Initilize Kalman filter 
  }
  
  void loop() {
    // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
    // Read normalized values 
    Vector normAccel = mpu.readNormalizeAccel();
  
    // Calculate Roll
    int roll = (atan2(normAccel.YAxis, normAccel.ZAxis)*180.0)/M_PI;
  
    float roll_correct = kalman_filter(roll);
    // Output
    Serial.print(" Roll = ");
    Serial.print(roll);
    Serial.print(" Roll_correct = ");
    Serial.print(roll_correct);
    
    Serial.println();
    
    delay(10);
  }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    The figure below shows the raw data (green) and the output of the Kalman filter (gray). 
    As can be seen that the estimated roll has a smooth curve and less noize comparing to the measured roll angle.

<h2 class="subsection-heading">Example 2 of KF with Arduino</h2>

<p>
  In this example I will use MPU6050 sensor that provide an acceleration data and gyroscop data. Using the acceleration data to compute 
  the state \(x\) and the gyroscop data to correct the state. 
  </p>

  $$
    \theta = \theta_0 + \dot \theta  t + \frac 1 2  \ddot \theta  t^2
  $$
  <p>
  So the state will be \(\hat x = [\theta  { , } \dot \theta]^T \). where decribe the angle and the anguar velocity. 
  These describe our best estimation (\(\mu)\). Now the covariance will be 
  \( P_k = \begin{pmatrix} \Sigma_{\theta \theta} && \Sigma_{\theta \dot \theta} \\\ \Sigma_{\dot \theta \theta} && \Sigma_{\dot \theta \dot \theta}\end{pmatrix} \). 
  And our A matrix is shown below.
</p>

$$ 
    A_k = \begin{pmatrix} 1 && \Delta T \\\ 0 && 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>
  Therfore, the result of multiplication of \(x\) and \(A\) is a matrix (2x1) and shows below.
</p>
$$ 
    A_k x = \begin{pmatrix} \theta + \Delta T \dot \theta \\\ \dot \theta \end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>
  now on the control pat which is the angular acceleration where \(u=[\ddot \theta]\), and 
  \(B = \begin{pmatrix} \frac 1 2 \Delta t^2 \\\ \Delta t \end{pmatrix} \) and 
  the result of the multiplication between \(u\) and \(B\) is 
</p>

$$
  Bx = \begin{pmatrix} \ddot \theta \frac 1 2 \Delta t^2 \\\ \ddot \theta \Delta t \end{pmatrix} 
$$

<p>
  Now we are going to update the state station using actual measurments \(Y_k = CX_k + z_k\), where 
  \(C=\begin{pmatrix} 1 && 0 \\\ 0 && 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(C=\begin{pmatrix} \theta \\\ \dot \theta \end{pmatrix}\)
</p>

<p>
  The below code is implemented in arduino using MPU6050 sensors and it is based on the work of 
  <a href="http://blog.tkjelectronics.dk/2012/09/a-practical-approach-to-kalman-filter-and-how-to-implement-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a> Lauszus </a>. 
  Where I modified to be used in class form.
</p>

<p>
  The full code shows below
</p>


<p>
  The figure blow shows the output of the code as can be seen the estimation row angle is getting much better and smoother.
