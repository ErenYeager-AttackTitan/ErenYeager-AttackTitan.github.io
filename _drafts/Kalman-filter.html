<p>
    I wrote a controller for a differential drives mobile robot with Arduino in the previous post. 
    The controller takes two inputs \(v\) and \(w\), and generate three output which is the state of the robot \(x, y,\theta\). 
    The output of the odometer was not accurate due to different factors which the most important one is the wheel slipping, 
    encoder resolutions and the measurement accuracy. 
    In this post, I am going to write an extended Kalman filter to correct the odometer using other information such as LADAR reading, 
    IMU or radar. 
</p>

    Kalman filter is a well-known set of mathematical equations for discrete values. 
    The advantage of the Kalman filter is that use only the previous state to predict the current state. 
    To summarise, the Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations used to estimate the future state 
    based on an educated guess, where the Kalman filter uses in any environment with uncertain information.
</p>

<p>
    To estimate the current state \(x_t\) using Kalman filter there are three input required which are controller \(u_t\), correction \(z_t\) and prevoiuse state \(x_{t-1}\). 
</p>


<p>
Starting with the model equations as shown below, which is an improved version of the old model.
 The new model has two states which (1) \(D_l \neq D_r\) and the equation below shows the output 
</p>


$$ \begin{pmatrix}x^{‘} \\\ y^{‘}  \\\  \theta^{‘} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}x \\\ y \\\  \theta \end{pmatrix} 
+ \begin{pmatrix} (R + \frac w 2)(sin(\theta+\alpha) – sin(\theta) \\\ (R + \frac w 2)(-cos(\theta+\alpha) + cos(\theta)  \\\  \alpha \end{pmatrix} \tag{1} \label{1}
$$ 

<p>
    and (2) where \(D_l = D_r\) and the model become as below which is matching what we descripe in the first post.
</p>

$$ \begin{pmatrix}x^{‘} \\\ y^{‘}  \\\  \theta^{‘} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}x \\\ y \\\  \theta \end{pmatrix} 
+ \begin{pmatrix} D_r sin(\theta) \\\ D_l cos(\theta) \\\  0 \end{pmatrix} \tag{2}
$$ 

<p>
    Note that the steps below is applied for both cases when \(D_l \neq D_r \) and \(D_l = D_r \).
</p>

<p>
Where in \eqref{1} \(\alpha = \frac{D_r – D_l} w\) and \(R = \frac {D_l} {\alpha} \). \(D_l\) 
and \(D_r \) are the distance the robot
 moved for left and right wheel respectively. By close analysis of the above 
 equations we know that there are two group 
 \(x,u\) of variable which belong to state and controller. 
 And these variables are belong to \(g = (x, u)\) function. 
 Where \(x = (x,y,\theta)\) and \(u=(D_l , D_r)\).
</p>
$$ \begin{pmatrix}x^ {‘} \\\ y^{‘}  \\\  \theta^{‘} \end{pmatrix} = g(x,y,\theta, D_l , D_r) \tag{3} $$

<p>
    The function below is used to compute the g matrix where the input is the state, and the output is G matrix 3x3.

    The blow is the linear equation of Kalman filters where \(A_t, B_t\) are the factors of prediction and correction, respectively. 

</p>
$$ x_t = A_t x_{t-1} + B_t u_t$$
$$ \overline \mu_t = A_t \mu_{t-1} + B_t u_t$$
$$ \sum = A_t \sum_{t-1} {A_t}^T + R_t$$

<p>
Because our problem is nonlinear due to the present of the rotation matrix we will take the Jacobian matrix of g which is the derivative of \(\frac {\delta g} {\delta state}\) where the state is \([x,y,\theta]^T\). Therefore \(G : \frac  {\delta g_1} {\delta x} ,  \frac  {\delta g_1} {\delta y}, \frac  {\delta g_1} {\delta \theta} \)
</p>

$$ x_t = g(x_{t-1}, u_t) $$
$$ \overline \mu_t = g(mu_{t-1}, u_t) $$
$$
G : \begin{pmatrix}\frac  {\delta g_1} {\delta x} &&   \frac  {\delta g_1} {\delta y}&&  \frac  {\delta g_1} {\delta \theta} \\\
 \frac  {\delta g_2} {\delta x} &&  \frac  {\delta g_2} {\delta y}&&  \frac  {\delta g_2} {\delta \theta} \\\ 
 \frac  {\delta g_3} {\delta x}&& \frac  {\delta g_3} {\delta y}&&  \frac  {\delta g_3} {\delta \theta} \end{pmatrix}
$$

<p>
    After taking the derivative of the state, we end up with the \(G\) matrix, which show below
</p>

$$ G : \begin{pmatrix}  1 &&   0&&  (R + \frac w 2)(-cos(\theta+\alpha) - cos(\theta) \\\ 
0&&  1 &&  (R + \frac w 2)(sin (\theta+\alpha) - sin(\theta)\\\ 0 && 0 && 1\end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>
The below code is the coding of the G where the function take the state as input and return a matrix \((3x3)\).
</p>
<p>
Next we need to compute controller where \(R_t = V_t \sum_{control} {V_t}^T\) where
 \(\sum_{control} = \begin{pmatrix} {\sigma_{D_l}}^2 && 0 \\\ 0 && {\sigma_{D_r}}^2 \end{pmatrix} \) 
 is the covariance matrix (2x2), and \(V_t  = \frac {\delta g} {\delta{control}} \) which is (3x2) matrix.
     Therefore \(V_t\) is shown below after taking the derivative of g in relate to the control value. Note that  \(\alpha = \frac{D_r – D_l} w\) 
     and \(R = \frac {D_l} {\alpha} \) during taking the derivative.
</p>
$$ V_t : \begin{pmatrix}  \frac{wr} {D_r – D_l}^2 (sin(theta^{‘}) - sin(theta)) - \frac {D_r + D_l}{2(D_r-D_l)}cos(theta^{‘})  &&   
 \frac{-wr} {D_r – D_l}^2 (sin(theta^{‘}) - sin(theta)) + \frac {D_r + D_l}{2(D_r-D_l)}cos(theta^{‘}) \\\  
  \frac{wr} {D_r – D_l}^2 (cos(theta^{‘}) + cos(theta)) - \frac {D_r + D_l}{2(D_r-D_l)}sin(theta^{‘})  &&
   \frac{-wr} {D_r – D_l}^2 (cos(theta^{‘}) + cos(theta)) + \frac {D_r + D_l}{2(D_r-D_l)}sin(theta^{‘})  \\\ 
   -\frac 1 w && \frac 1 w \end{pmatrix}
$$
<p>
To sum up the prediction step we need to computer both covariance matrix value in state estimation and control correction \(\sum_{state} \) and \( \sum_{control}\). 
</p>
$$ {\mu_{D_l}}^2 = (\alpha_1 D_l)^2 + (\alpha_2 (D_L – D_R))^2$$
$$ {\mu_{D_r}}^2 = (\alpha_1 D_r)^2 + (\alpha_2 (D_L – D_R))^2$$

<p>
    The code below shows the implementation of both functons, 
    where
