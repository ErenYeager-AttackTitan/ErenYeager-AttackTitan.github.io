  title: Games
  ide: games
  description: Games are about fun, friendship, and memories that remain long after the play is over. It is bit natural that the immersive power of games is harnessed to address real-life issues. A lot of research has gone into understanding how games can be used in different situations and their potential is mostly untapped. Not only do games provide an inexpensive way of mimicking real-life situations, but they also allow us to learn and experience in a safe space, and the learning stays with us. At Fields of View, we create gaming-simulations â€“ games that can be used for learning and education; decision-making; and participatory planning.

  title: Simulations
  ide: simulations
  description: Simulations model real world processes over time. With increasing computing power at our disposal, it is possible to simulate different real world scenarios. For instance, games such as SimCity are virtual simulations of cities and their inhabitants using cellular automata to model real processes. Engineering simulations such as wind tunnel simulations are used extensively to design and test the aerodynamic capabilities of aircrafts and auto mobiles. Immersive simulators such as flight and auto mobile simulators are used extensively by car manufacturers to train people and to improve and calibrate their designs. Simulations are also widely used for planning purposes, such as resource planning, city planning, disaster and safety planning etc. Computer simulations present results in a visual interactive space. Our goal is to use computer and virtual simulations to understand and model the complexity of a problem in order to guide data collection, educate and train people and help in the decision making process.
