My name is Jacek Kr√≥likowski and I'm a programmer from Warsaw, Poland. I have recently graduated from the University
of Warsaw and have recently moved to London for a [job with Skype](http://www.skypeworklife.com/).

In my spare time I code in scala, do bouldering, snowboard, play the bass or play computer games if I'm to lazy to do
any of the former.

Wanna get in touch? Send me an email at *jacek(d0t)krolikowski@almost-done.net* (make sure you replace the "(d0t)"
 in the address with a ".") or try an appropriate link from the footer ;)
