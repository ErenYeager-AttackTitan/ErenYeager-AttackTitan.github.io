## 1 Create a github account

If you're a developer you probably have one, but if not, just go to this [link](https://github.com/join)

Fill out the form and set your account:

## 2 Fork a jekyll theme

While logged in Github, go to [this link](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) for the theme I'm using. 
Just go there and hit the fork button to clone that repo under your usename.

![fork_repo](https://i.imgur.com/7s7zL8s.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

This will result on a copy of that repository under your username.

> Note: I've changed the repo name, at the start it will get forked with the same title.

## 3 Modify the config.yaml

If you know a bit of git, you know how to modify a repo in local and then push it to sync it with github. But, for the sake of simplicity I'll use the online GitHub editor.

Navigate to your repo, and then click on the `_config.yml` file.

Edit that file clicking the pencil icon on the top:

![edit_github](https://i.imgur.com/kTqj3YQ.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

The options you have are:

title
  : This is the title of the blog
  
email
  : The email on the contact part

description
  : The subtitle/description of your blog

author
  : Your name

baseurl
  : This will be `/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll`. If you change the name of the repo, you should use that name here. eg. I changed the repo name to `blog` so I use `/blog` here.

url
  : `https://<your_github_username>.github.io`. eg. https://*saul-r*.github.io

And for the Social Profiles that appear on the bottom of the page:

twitter_username
  : Your username on twitter

github_username
  : Github username

facebook_username
  : Facebook username 


## 4 Set up github pages

On the repo, go to settings and scroll down to the GithubPages section.

Use the master branch as source:

![pages](https://i.imgur.com/WKuOKt2.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

And you should start seeing a rocket symbol on the github page:

![rocket](https://i.imgur.com/S6byrxP.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

This displays the status of your page's deployments. You can click on the latest one to see how your page looks.


## 5 Write your first post

I'm a huge fan of Markdown, so I'll use that instead of cumbersome html to write my posts. If you've never heard of markdown, check it out [this 5 minutes tutorial about it](https://www.remarq.io/articles/five-minutes-to-markdown-mastery/). It's much simpler than a Word document, the only thing you'll ever miss from word is clippo.

Let's create a new file under the `_posts` folder.

![create_file](https://i.imgur.com/IE0crlO.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Again, I'll be using the Github editor for convenience.

The file should be named like `YYYY-MM-DD-some-name.md`. For example `2019-05-16-first-post.md`
Paste this code inside:

```markdown

Links are super simple too:

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)

You can even use gifs:

```

Commit the file using the button on the bottom of the page.

Check the deployments, and see when the deployment is ready. It's usually less than a minute to deploy.

Done
