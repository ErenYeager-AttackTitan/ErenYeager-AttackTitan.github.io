description: Vaibhav is currently a student at National Law University, Delhi. He is interested (though his friends would rather use obsessed) in city planning, different modes of transport and can spend hours on Google Maps following traffic patterns in other parts of the world. When he is not talking about the metro being built in some random part of the city, he likes to travel and read.
