A very famous Assamese song is *Bidexot Apun Manuh*, sung by Saju for the television series of the same name. I thought for a 
while what would be the best English translation and somehow I failed to come up with one which would best express the feeling of the 
Assamese original. *Bidexot Apun Manuh* means *own people abroad*, if it is translated literally, but for someone who has stayed 
abroad for an extended period of time, it means a whole lot more. The feeling of oneness, of the camradarie or even the feeling of 
friendship is quite different with your own than with people from some other community. This is not a nationalistic thought, it 
is but what human nature is. I did not feel this to such a degree as I have felt it in the last two days (12-14 October), when I 
attended the annual get together of the Assamese community residing in mainland Europe. If I were to describe the feeling I had 
after I participated in the get together, it would be ***overwhelmed***. The word might mean many things, but I was really overwhelmed 
by the love that everyone had for everyone present, I was overwhelmed by the feeling of a community in getting everything done and 
I was overwhelmed by seeing random people merge together and develop a friendship which I have very rarely seen.

This time, the get together was held for the first time outside Germany; and I am very happy that it was in Austria, for several reasons. 
Perhaps, the first reason would be selfish. The commute time from Vienna was less than one hour. But the most important reason 
for me was I became actively involved in the arrangement. The trust that the people who have organized it in the past placed on me 
and Sudeshna (a fellow Assamese in Vienna) was immense. They gave us directions and we did some of the local organizing, but it 
was nothing compared to the effort that everyone put in at the event, which was held on the foothills of the *Wienerwald* (the Vienna 
woods), at a small village in Austria called *Sparbach*. Perhaps, at no other time in history has so many people gathered togetehr as 
a group in Austria. It was a surreal experience for me.

Yashobanta Da (the person who provided the impetus for the whole meet) summarized the feeling aptly, at the conclusion when he 
said that it feels like a big marriage party has ended and everyone went back to their respective places with many memories, good food 
and a ceratin sadness of having to leave behind their community in Europe; their *bidexot apun manuh*. If I were to write a *minutes of the meeting* 
post to descirbe the *milon*, it would not do justice to it. The *milon* was much more than a bunch of people meeting at a fixed 
place on a fixed date to eat a few common meals. It was a time to cherish our **Assam**, it was a time to get to known the people 
of our motherland and talk in Assamese. Last year I read *In Other Words* by Jhumpa Lahiri, where she described how difficult it 
was to acclimatize to Italian when she started to live in Rome. The book stuck a chord and it has always remained ingrained in 
my mind. So, it was a fresh breeze of Assamese which did two things for me: first, it made me feel much better, and second, it made 
me a bit homesick. This homesickness is worse than any I have felt before. When everyone left, and I came back today to an empty 
apartment (my flatmate is enjoying his motherland now - Nepal), the pangs of lonliness were felt immensly. But, I talked to my 
parents, I talked to my fiancee and I talked with Himan Da (another fellow Assamese in Vienna), and it made me feel better. I began 
to think that, this is not the end. I will meet all these wonderful people again, maybe in the next get together, wherever it is. Or, 
perhaps even before if I visit the different friends I made in the last two days.

The bond started for me, even before the offical meet when I met Srimanta Da. We realized that our original hometowns (-villages) 
were less than 5 km apart in Assam. It does not get better than this. When I went to the get together, I went with Sudeshna and Kabya, 
a soft spoken and kind fellow Assamese from Rome. Kabya and I talked before and in the get together, and it was a pleasure to meet him 
and to watch him help in the running of the meet. I had to leave the get together for some work in Vienna on Friday, but I went there 
for the second time at night to find a room full of people. All speaking Assamese, it was heaven. I met Eashan (with whom I have 
only conversed in Instagram; strange, I know), then I met Satya Da, Pranjal Da, Sawat Da, Rakesh Da and so many others. Everyone was 
warm and everyone made me feel welcome. It made me realize the bonds that we, human beings hold; even without knowing.

Saturday was the day of the *bhoj*, an excellent meal made by Yashobanta Da and Rita Bow, helped by several others. In fact, everyone 
in the meet did something or the other to make it a succesful one. I have never seen such coordination and such switftness in doing 
things. The success of the meet lies with everyone who attended (irrespective of whether I mention them by name or not). After the bhoj, 
we had a small cultural event, which although it officially eneded around midnight, but some of the *kharkhowas* stayed up till 
6 am crooning to songs by Zubeen Da, Jitul Da, Bhupen Da and even Kishore Da. The start attraction of the show was undoubtedly Jitendra, 
a melodious voice who sang not less than six songs (with a strong public demand), paired brilliantly on instruments by Himan Da and 
Satya Da. Oh, what bliss it was to listen to him sing; and then later to watch the *nasonis* dancing to Bihu and Jhumur. I thought, 
if only this happened every weekend.

But, like every good thing this meet also ended; with hope and promises to meet again. Next year, in a different country but with the 
same people. I will now count the days for this to happen.

I close the post with an English translation of *Bidexot Apun Manuh* (which does not capture the original in any way).

Every heartbeat holds this for eternity,
This intimate love.
Unbreakable, unstoppable,
This mysterous bond.

Life has it's two wings,
And the whole sky - the playground.
They fly away, far away,
To nest in an unknown land.

In the moments of solitude, we remember
Our brethen abroad.
Our brethen abroad.

With the waves of the Thames,
And the banks of the Mississippi;
We search for our friendly Luit.
Even in this distance
Every second the heart yearns
For our utopian Subansiri.

With the waves of the Thames,
And the banks of the Mississippi;
We search for our friendly Luit.
Even in this distance
Every second the heart yearns
For our utopian Subansiri.

We brush away the momentary shadows,
And search for our life's Majuli.
In the moments of solitude, we remember
Our brethen abroad.
Our brethen abroad.

Every heartbeat holds this for eternity,
This intimate love.
Unbreakable, unstoppable,
What is this mysterous bond.

Life has it's two wings,
And the whole sky - the playground.
They fly away, far away,
To nest in an unknown land.

In the moments of solitude, we remember
Our brethen abroad.
Our brethen abroad.
