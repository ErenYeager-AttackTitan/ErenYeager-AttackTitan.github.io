The poem below was written on 26th December, 2012 and posted on a blog that I used to manage. But I let the domain expire and thought that would be the end of it. Apparently, the people at way back machine thought it to be a good idea to preserve the blog. So here it goes.

How do I feel now?  
 A feeling lost in the trenches,  
 Deep down I know it a mistake,  
 Maybe the feeling shared,  
 The cold winter evenings  
 Make little effort to help me dry  
 Its just a lost cause, still I try  
 The dark ravages of the past haunts me,  
 The mock anger at times taunts me,  
 I stay awake thinking  
 And praying,  
 And hoping,  
 That someday somehow,  
 All will be right.  
 I shall take you in my arms,  
 Look into your eyes,  
 And say, deep down  
 I will always love you.
