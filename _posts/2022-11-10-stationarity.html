    Before we jump into looking if our time series are stationary or not. Firsly, we need to understand what it means and why it is important.

    According to \parencite{Li2016}, "A time series being stationary means that its joint probability distribution is time-invariant."

    In a regression model, the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators are not consistent for non-stationary series and the standard statistical tests are not valid. Additionally, many of statistical tests assume that the data is stationary.
