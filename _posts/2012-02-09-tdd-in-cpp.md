For my classes I recorded screencasts about [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), and, because lately I’m focused mostly on c++, I decided to delve into
[google test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/)
 instead of the regular jMock and Mockito. Initially I wanted to make it a tutorial showcasing all the tools
within the library, but it ended up being a TDD Kata solving example with a short introduction about how to set up the
development environment.

The narrative is kind of slow, but I guess the main issue for people reading this particular page is that it’s not in English.
