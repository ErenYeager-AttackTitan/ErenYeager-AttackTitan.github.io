<p>As part of our fellowship with Measurement Canada, we are constantly looking for opportunities to work with our partners to build digital capacity within the organization. Thank you to everyone who joined us for our first Lunch and Learn (L&L); we were thrilled to learn that we had over 60 participants! For those that were unable to join and wanted to, you can find the presentation slide <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">here.</a></p>

<p>As a recap, we talked about two key things:</p>

<ol class="pg-list">
  <li>What is Design Thinking?</li>
  <li>What is Agile and how can it be applied?</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is Design Thinking?</h2>
</p>Design Thinking is a creative problem solving technique with the user at the centre. As Steve Jobs famously said:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote" style="text-align:center;">Test You have to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology - not the other way around.</blockquote>

<p>Design Thinking challenges us to start with understanding and empathizing with the end userâ€™s pain points. By understanding the users needs and wants, Apple was able to re-imagine and create products that set itself apart from its competitors. During our stay at MC, we will also be using this methodology to help us create an impactful digital solution for our end users.</p>
