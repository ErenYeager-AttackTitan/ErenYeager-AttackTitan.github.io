One of the first places we visited in Wales (after we shifted to Cardiff) was **Hay-on-Wye**, the world’s first booktown. It is a magical place for any bibliophile, and I have enjoyed my visits to Hay-on-Wye quite a lot. So, when we decided to visit Scotland over the Easter break this year, I thought it would be great to visit **Wigtown**, Scotland’s own booktown. But without a car it was quite difficult to do a day-trip, so I decided to skip Wigtown on this visit. One of the main reasons of wanting to visit Wigtown was to visit **The Bookshop**, the main attraction for book-lovers and the largest second hand bookseller in Scotland.

I had seen **Shaun Bythell**’s (the owner of the shop) diaries of a bookseller in several bookstores before planning this trip. Somehow I never bought a copy because I didn’t think I would enjoy reading a diary. Since the plan to visit Wigtown was cancelled I did pick up Bythell’s book, in **Thistle Books, Glasgow** to experience a bit of the town on its pages. Once I started to read, I couldn’t stop and enjoyed every bit of the book. The book had one very huge impact on my habits, I have since decided to not buy any book directly from **Amazon** (other sellers there are fine, so far). Shaun explains in his inimitable style about how Amazon is cutting into the margins of booksellers everywhere. Although I knew about this but it didn’t hit me hard until I had read Shaun’s book.

The advantages of visiting a bookshop can hardly be exaggerated for bibliophiles. Over the last few years I have discovered several genres of books which I would not have normally read if I had not seen the books in a brick-and-mortar shop. That is reason enough to like them, but sometimes serendipities work which makes them seem even more appealing. I have had several such instances in the past few weeks itself. Let me describe two of them.

I am quite interested in reading about Vienna (since 2015, I lived there for four very beautiful years), and one book which is on my to-read list is **Joseph Roth**’s **The Radetzky March**. I haven’t thought about this for a long time, but on a recent visit to **Waterstones** in Cardiff, while browsing the WWII section (another of my interests) I came across a selection of essays that Roth wrote after he left Austria, titled **On the End of the World**. I am now looking forward to reading this collection, something which I would never have known existed if I had not visited a bookstore.

A recent book I read was **Edmund de Waal**’s **The Hare with Amber Eyes**, where he mentions an unpublished novel written by his mother **Elisabeth de Waal** about a visit to Vienna after WWII was over. Edmund’s book was published in 2010 and so I assumed the novel was never published and did not look for it, even though the subject seemed quite interesting to me. On a recent visit to Bath, I took a friend to **Persephone Books** who mainly publishes old out-of-print books by female authors. Since, I have visited the store earlier, I decided to sit outside the entrance and look at their **Biannually** which lists all of their publications. While I was skimming through the pages I noticed the surname de Waal, and immediately stopped to look at what it said. Imagine my surprise when I saw that the book mentioned by Edmund was published by Persephone Books in 2013. The title is **The Exiles Return** and without wasting another second I went in and purchased my own copy.

These were two very happy moments for me, which just goes on to show the importance of a good bookstore.
