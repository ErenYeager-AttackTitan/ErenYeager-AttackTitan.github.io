intended: Simulation scientists, Social scientists.
keywords: Agent-based simulations, Socio-technical system.
intro: Phoenix is an agent-based simulation platform, developed at Fields of View. It is distributed and modular by design, and can run highly scalable simulations.
description: <p class="simple-content">Agent-based simulations are powerful methods to model complex systems (such as cities) in a bottom-up fashion, in order to study the interactions of the sub-systems (such as infrastructures, people, policies, institutional frameworks, etc.). Existing agent-based simulation platforms either focus on the number of agents that can be created, or on the number of functionalities provided. In Phoenix, we have separated the different modules such as visualisation, communication subsystem, database engine, to name a few. Phoenix is distributed by design - simulations can be distributed across multiple computers in the same network. These factors make Phoenix very scalable.</p>
