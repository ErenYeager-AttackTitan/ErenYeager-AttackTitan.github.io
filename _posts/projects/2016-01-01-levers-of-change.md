description: <p class="simple-content">The IWI is a way to acknowledge and articulate the interconnectedness of the economy, environment, and human well-being. A few decades from now, perhaps sooner, we will be talking about the IWI rather than the GDP as a way to measure development. But that requires different kinds of audience, including students, policymakers, politicians, educators, economists, and other such groups to understand the IWI and how it differs from and complements other indices.<p/><p class="simple-content">Players prepare budgets using their judgements based on the national economic indices that are provided. This would include the IWI as well along with some of standard development indicators. The players will determine a course fiscal budget plan along with basic monetary policy based on the information provided to them by the indicators. The players will be free to follow the information afforded to them by any of the economic indicators to determine their policies.</p>
