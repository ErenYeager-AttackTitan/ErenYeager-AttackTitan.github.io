description: <p class="simple-content">The IWI is a way to acknowledge and articulate the interconnectedness of the economy, environment, and human well-being. A few decades from now, perhaps sooner, we will be talking about the IWI rather than the GDP as a way to measure development. But that requires different kinds of audience, including students, policymakers, politicians, educators, economists, and other such groups to understand the IWI and how it differs from and complements other indices.<p/><p class="simple-content">In the game, players will be responsible for a country's well-being, and plan for the same by investing in different forms of capital, such as the human, natural, and produced capital. Players will have to balance their country's growth in GDP with long-term sustainability. The game will challenge players to plan for their country, while ensuring global sustainability.</p>
