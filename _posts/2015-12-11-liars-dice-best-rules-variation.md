I've been a semi-active board game nerd for quite a while now and I play wide variety of games, ranging from [jungle speed](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8098/jungle-speed) to [Battlestar Galactica](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37111/battlestar-galactica) and [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29). It's a huge universe to explore, but there's been one game that me and my friends have been playing for years now and it's still a crowd favourite. It can accommodate virtually any number of players, it's cheap (all you need is some dice), simple to explain, and - last but not least, drunk-people-friendly. If you can still count, you can still play and even if the table is all covered in beer, the dice couldn't care less.

But as with most things, the devil's in the details. Most people know some sort of version of the game, but there is one particular one that is both fun and perfectly fair - there's a winning move in every situation. I've recently been asked to write it up and share, soo...

# Prerequisites

You need between 2 and 20 people and 5 6-sided dice per person. You can use some dice cups to conceal your rolls but if the dice aren't too bit they're not necessary.

# Rules

Each player starts off with 5 dice. They all roll their dice, look at the result while concealing it from the other players. Next, starting from a randomly chosen player (or the owner of the dice), they take turns, bidding on the "state" of all the dice on the table.

Each bid consists of a die face (from 1 to 6) and a quantity of them (between 1 and the count of all the dice on the table). A bet of "two threes" means that the person claims there's a minimum of two dice with three pips on the face pointing up, between all players - under the cup of the person betting and everyone else around the table. It translates to "There are *at least* two dice with threes facing up on the table."

The next bidding person is the one to the left of the starting one. To continue the bidding, they have to name a bid that is "higher" than the previous one. The bid is "higher" if:

- the quantity of the dice is the same (2, in this scenario), but the named face is higher (4, 5, or 6 in this scenario). "Two fours" or "Two sixes" are such bids.
- the quantity of the dice is larger (3 or more in this scenario) and any face they choose (1 - 6). Examples: "three ones", "six sixes".

The betting continues clockwise around the table until someone decides to "call" the previous player's bid.

## Calling
To call a previous player's bid, you literally call them a liar. When that happens all of the players reveal their dice and see if the previous bid was accurate or not.

## "Spot-on"

## Beginner/kid-friendly variation

Instead of starting with 1 die and going all the way up to 5, everyone starts with 5 dice and they give one away every time they lose a round (instead of getting one more). This way the worse you're doing, the less information you have about the "global table state".
