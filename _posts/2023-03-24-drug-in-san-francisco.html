<p>San Francisco has been dealing with a serious drug problem for many years, having more drug crimes and overdose deaths than many other US cities.

<p>San Francisco has implemented a variety of strategies to try and combat this drug crisis, such as expanding access to addiction treatment and recovery services, increasing access to overdose prevention tools, and implementing harm reduction strategies like needle exchange programs. 

<p>In this article, we have analyzed a dataset containing crimes within San Francisco from the years 2003 to 2017. We will focus on drug crimes occurring in the years 2010-2017. We will be analyzing the effects of the strategies San Francisco have implemented to combat the drug crisis.

<h2 class="section-heading">Decrease in drug-related arrests!</h2>
  
<p>We can see from [figure 1] that there has been a strong decrease in the total number of drug-related crimes from 2010 to 2017. When comparing this to other crime categories such as assault, burglary, vandalism, and vehicle thefts, we can see that the decrease in drug-related crimes is going against the general trend. This comes from the fact that San Francisco’s strategy has been to focus on making it safer for drug-users and offering addiction treatment, and not to strike down hard on drug-users by arresting them. This has caused the number of drug arrests to more than halve from the year 2010 to 2017.

<h2 class="section-heading">More overdose deaths!</h2>
<p>If the drug-crisis was directly related to the number of drug-related arrests occurring per year, then this would be great progress. However, one thing that this graphic doesn’t show is the number of overdose deaths. According to the San Francisco Department of Public Health, the number of overdose deaths per year increased from 104 to 369 between 2010 to 2017. This has caused some skepticism of San Francisco’s strategy, with some saying this “progressive” strategy is killing hundreds of people (https://www.hoover.org/research/san-franciscos-progressive-drug-policies-kill-hundreds-annually).
