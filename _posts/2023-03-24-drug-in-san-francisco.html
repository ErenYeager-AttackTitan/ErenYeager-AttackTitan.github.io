<p>San Francisco has been dealing with a serious drug problem for many years, having more drug crimes and overdose deaths than many other US cities. The city’s history of drug use, boosted by the opioid epidemic which has swept across the United States over the past few decades, has caused this to be a problem that needed dealing with.
<p>San Francisco has implemented a variety of strategies to try and combat this drug crisis, such as expanding access to addiction treatment and recovery services, increasing access to overdose prevention tools, and implementing harm reduction strategies like needle exchange programs <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In this article, we have analyzed a dataset containing crimes within San Francisco from the years 2003 to 2017. We will focus on drug crimes occurring in the years 2010-2017. We will be analyzing the effects of the strategies San Francisco have implemented to combat the drug crisis.

  
<h2 class="section-heading">Drug-related arrests historic motion</h2>
<p>But before continuing, do you think drug related crime has risen or decreased over the years? What about the other categories? Please, interact with <em>Figure 1</em> where you can see 2010 crime activity and click the following years.</p>

<div class="container">
  <div class="column">
    <p>We can see from <em>Figure 1</em> that there has been a strong decrease in the total number of drug-related crimes from 2010 to 2017. When comparing this to other crime categories such as assault, burglary, vandalism, and vehicle thefts, we can see that the decrease in drug-related crimes is going against the general trend.</p>

    <p class="justified">This comes from the fact that the city strategy has focused on making it safer for drug-users and offering addiction treatment, instead of arresting them.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<p>This has caused the number of drug arrests to more than halve from the year 2010 to 2017. Police activity has reduced in terms of arrests and prosecution. However, we still have drug seizures or arrests. As you can see in the calendar plot (see <em>Figure 2</em>)</p>

  <div class="column">

<p>Let's dig into it. We have also made a heatmap with the drug crimes in the San Francisco Area (see <em>Figure 3</em>), where we can see some activity near the UN Plaza within that week. If you interact with the chart, and press "play" or "forward" you will visualize +40 arrests have been made <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup>, and according to the lead case agent more arrests are to come.</p>



<h2 class="section-heading">Lower number of reports means less overdose deaths?</h2>
<p>If the drug-crisis was directly related to the number of drug-related arrests occurring per year, then this would be great progress. However, one thing that this graphic doesn’t show is the number of overdose deaths. According to the San Francisco Department of Public Health, the number of overdose deaths per year increased from 104 to 369 between 2010 to 2017. This has caused some skepticism of San Francisco’s strategy, with some saying this “progressive” strategy is killing hundreds of people <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>Click on Play and see the locations by day of the narcotic crimes that ocurred during the 4th week of Jan, 2016.</p>

    <p>It is clear that many narcotic crimes ocurre in the area, is it possible that the police is prioritizing it?</p>

<p>If that is the case, police officers are survailing less other areas? Does this generate a bias?</p>
