Here we take a look at a lovely [paper](https://program.ismir2020.net/poster_2-13.html) by Fred Bruford et al. that presents and evaluates a set of
engineered features for drum pattern analysis in the symbolic domain.

It gathers both new and pre-existing features in literature, including rhythm features, similarity metrics, and microtiming features. The final
[toolbox](https://github.com/fredbru/GrooveToolbox) is evaluated on drum loop similarity perception experiments, where the authors are able to
find significant correlations between each feature type and similarity scores.
