<p>New York City is among the major metropolitan areas in the world, with a population above 8 million, not only known for its iconics landmarks, cultural richness and diversity but also for its high cost of living and criminality.</p>
  This study provides an in-depth analysis of the trends, patterns, and correlation with some indicators that might be associated with gun violence and specifically, shooting incidents,
  which have been a persistent problem in the city. The research is based on extensive data collection from INSERT SOURCE-URL and statistical and visual analysis learned trhough the Social Data Analysis and Visualization course,
  which reveal important insights into the nature and extent of gun incidents in the city. The findings of the study have important implications for those who seek to address this pressing public safety issue.
<p>The city of New York has implemented various strategies and initiatives to combat gun violence. 
  Here are some of the ways that the city representatives have tried to fight against gun violence:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gun Control Laws: New York City has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country. The city has implemented measures such as background checks, limits on gun purchases, and requirements for gun owners to register their firearms. These measures aim to prevent criminals and individuals with a history of violence or mental illness from obtaining firearms</li>
  <li>Policing Strategies: The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has implemented various policing strategies to reduce gun violence, such as increasing police presence in high-crime areas, using data-driven approaches to identify and target gun violence hotspots, and conducting gun buyback programs.</li>
  <li>Community Outreach: City representatives have also focused on community outreach programs to address the root causes of gun violence, such as poverty, lack of education, and unemployment. These programs aim to provide opportunities for at-risk youth and promote positive behaviors.</li>
  <li>Partnerships: The city has also formed partnerships with community organizations, faith-based groups, and businesses to work together in addressing gun violence. These partnerships help to raise awareness, provide resources, and create a network of support for individuals affected by gun violence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have these measure been effective enough over the years? PASTE SHOUTINGS PER YEAR </p>

    <p>According to our studies, in the period from 2006 to 2019 there was a remarkable decrease in shootings as it can be seen in Figure 1, with a clear negative trend.</p>

    <p><br><br>However, it can be seen that during the last 3 years, things have gone backwards in the Big Apple, as more shootings have been recorded; as an example, 2020 has duplicated its shootings comparing      to its previous year. We found this unexpected, as this was the year were most people were at home in lockdown.</p>

<p> In order to analize the consequences of these crimes, we have picked a few topics that we considered they could be correlated with a negative impact.



<h2 class="section-heading">Impact on school attendance</h2>
<p> The first thing that came to our minds is that gun violence and shootings could have a significant impact on school attendance. When incidents occur in the vicinity of schools or within the community, parents may be hesitant to send their children to school out of concern for their safety. In some cases, schools may be closed or placed on lockdown as a precautionary measure, further disrupting students' attendance and academic progress.

Additionally, students who are exposed to or directly affected by gun violence may experience trauma, anxiety, and fear, which can affect their ability to attend school and concentrate on their studies. https://nypost.com/2023/02/18/nyc-school-related-violence-surges-deaths-increase/

    <div style="float: left; width: 20%;">
    <p>Figure 4 shows the correlation between school attendant and number of shootings. Logically, all weekend and other non-school days have been excluded in the analysis.
Figure 5 represents the impact on attendance in the exact day the shooting incidents took place, the one on the right, the impact of these incidents the day after they ocurred.</p>

Overall, the city representatives have taken a multi-faceted approach to combatting gun violence in New York City, addressing the issue from various angles to create a comprehensive strategy. <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In this article, we have analyzed a dataset containing crimes within San Francisco from the years 2003 to 2017. We will focus on drug crimes occurring in the years 2010-2017. We will be analyzing the effects of the strategies San Francisco have implemented to combat the drug crisis.

  
<p>But before continuing, do you think drug related crime has risen or decreased over the years? What about the other categories? Please, interact with <em>Figure 1</em> where you can see 2010 crime activity and click the following years.</p>

<div class="container">
  <div class="column">
    <p>We can see from <em>Figure 1</em> that there has been a strong decrease in the total number of drug-related crimes from 2010 to 2017. When comparing this to other crime categories such as assault, burglary,</p>

<p>offering addiction treatment, instead of arresting them. This has caused the number of drug arrests to more than halve from the year 2010 to 2017. Police activity has reduced in terms of arrests and prosecution. However, we still have drug seizures or arrests. As you can see in the calendar plot, <em>Figure 2</em>,</p>

<p>Let's dig into it. We have also made a heatmap with the drug crimes in the San Francisco Area (see <em>Figure 3</em>), where we can see some activity near the UN Plaza within that week. If you interact with the chart, and press "play" or "forward" you will visualize +40 arrests have been made <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup>, and according to the lead case agent more arrests are to come.</p>



<h2 class="section-heading">Lower number of reports means less overdose deaths?</h2>
<p>If the drug-crisis was directly related to the number of drug-related arrests occurring per year, then this would be great progress. However, one thing that this graphic doesn’t show is the number of overdose deaths. According to the San Francisco Department of Public Health, the number of overdose deaths per year increased from 104 to 369 between 2010 to 2017. This has caused some skepticism of San Francisco’s strategy, with some saying this “progressive” strategy is killing hundreds of people <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

  </div>
</div>
<p>If that is the case, police officers are survailing less other areas? Does this generate a bias?</p>
