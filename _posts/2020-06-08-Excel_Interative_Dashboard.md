The dashboard is built by Excel with features [Pivot Table](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576), [Pivot Chart](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivotchart-c1b1e057-6990-4c38-b52b-8255538e7b1c) and [Slicer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-slicers-to-filter-data-249f966b-a9d5-4b0f-b31a-12651785d29d).

The funny parts of this dashboard is that you can get what you'd like to see by apply **filters** at the bottom. All charts will be changed as long as you **click specfic buttons**.

The data only includes 2000 rows and it slow down my Excel when making changes, especially formats and layouts. For data with more rows/records, [Python](https://www.python.org) or [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is probably a better choice to build such a dashboard.
