<b>A BRIEF HISTORY OF FACIAL RECOGNITION </b>

<p>Facial recognition was first pioneered in 1964 by Woody Bledsoe, along with Charles Bisson and Helen Chan Wolf. Because their project was funded by an anonymous intelligence agency, the majority of the trio’s research and work was never made public. However, it was later disclosed that their early work included manual mapping of facial features, and then mathematically rotating them with a computer.
</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the accuracy of facial recognition was further evolved to account for lip thickness, hair color, and 19 other specific identifying markets. Come the 1980s and 1990s, linear algebra began to be applied to facial recognition technology. A decade later, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency coordinated to create a facial image database.
</p>
<p>In 2006, the Face Recognition Grand Challenge was launched – it was designed in order to support the U.S. government’s efforts to use facial recognition. The FRGC studied and rated modern facial recognition algorithms and found that they had become 100 times more accurate over the last decade.
</p>
<p>From 2010 to the present time, we began to run into face recognition more and more in our daily lives. For instance, there is Facebook’s algorithm for tagging faces, the iPhone’s new capabilities to unlock via FaceID, and face scanning at concerts, stadiums, airports, and more.

<p>Face recognition is a way of recognizing a human face through technology. A facial recognition system uses biometrics to map facial features from a photograph or video. It compares the information with a database of known faces to find a match. Facial recognition can help verify personal identity, but it also raises privacy issues.</p>


<b>How facial recognition works</b>
You might be good at recognizing faces. You probably find it a cinch to identify the face of a family member, friend, or acquaintance. You’re familiar with their facial features — their eyes, nose, mouth — and how they come together.

That’s how a facial recognition system works, but on a grand, algorithmic scale. Where you see a face, recognition technology sees data. That data can be stored and accessed. For instance, half of all American adults have their images stored in one or more facial-recognition databases that law enforcement agencies can search, according to a Georgetown University study.

So how does facial recognition work? Technologies vary, but here are the basic steps:

Step 1. A picture of your face is captured from a photo or video. Your face might appear alone or in a crowd. Your image may show you looking straight ahead or nearly in profile.

Step 2. Facial recognition software reads the geometry of your face. Key factors include the distance between your eyes and the distance from forehead to chin. The software identifies facial landmarks — one system identifies 68 of them — that are key to distinguishing your face. The result: your facial signature.

Step 3. Your facial signature — a mathematical formula — is compared to a database of known faces. And consider this: at least 117 million Americans have images of their faces in one or more police databases. According to a May 2018 report, the FBI has had access to 412 million facial images for searches.

Step 4. A determination is made. Your faceprint may match that of an image in a facial recognition system database.

I have written a face recognition system that's how I created it in Python OpenCV library.
