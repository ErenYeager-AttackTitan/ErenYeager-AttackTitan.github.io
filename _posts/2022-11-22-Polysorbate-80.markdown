What Is Polysorbate 80?

Polysorbate 80 is a little known synthetic compound, also known as Tween 80. Its uses are as a food emulsifier, a surfactant in cosmetics, and as an inert substance used as a diluent or vehicle for a drug.

In food chemistry, Polysorbate 80 can function as an emulsifier and as surfactant. Emulsifiers allow the mixing of oil and water; surfactants reduce the surface tension between a liquid and a solid.

Where can I find Polysorbate 80 in my lifestyle?

Food:
Polysorbate 80 is a food additive with emulsifying qualities used in processed foods (the ability to prevent fats from separating). You can find it in commercially made frozen desserts, baking mixes, icings, and canned veggies, among other items

Cosmetics:
Polysorbate 80 is used as an emulsifier to blend oil and water in cosmetics. Polysorbate 80 is a common ingredient in hair care products and is used to blend thicker, heavier oils. Adding this ingredient to oil-based cosmetics may also help to eliminate clumping and settling.

Cosmetically Found in:  hair care products, skin fresheners, cosmetics bases, foundations, shampoos, permanent waves products, fragrance powders, bath products, face cleansers, infant shampoos, face creams, linen sprays, balms, ointments, pomades, hair sprays, sunblocks

Medicine:
polysorbate 80 is a common excipient and solubilizing agent. Polysorbate 80 is in lotions, medicinal preparations (e.g., vitamin oils, vaccination, and intravenous preparations).  Yes, it is in the Covid 19 vaccine!  An excipient is an inert substance employed as the medium or vehicle for the administration of an active medicine.

Medically Found In:
medical lotions, vitamin oils, vaccination preparations, tablets, Docetaxel, Epoetin/Darbepoetin, Fosaprepitant (used in cancer for chemotherapy, supportive care, or prophylaxis), solubilizing agent for IV preparations, washing agent in immunoassays, solubilizing agent for membrane proteins, lysis solutions for mammalian cells in biochemical applications, Amiodarone, vitamin K, Etoposide, different vaccines, protein biotherapeutics

How Might Polysorbate 80 Be Bad For Me?

A article published by NIH's National Library of Medicine reports: 

"Polysorbate 80 and Adverse Events
Polysorbate 80 has been associated with a number of adverse events. In food, small concentrations of undigested polysorbate 80 may enhance bacterial translocation across intestinal epithelia, a potential explanation for an observed increase in the incidence of Crohn’s disease. In drug formulations, polysorbate 80 has been implicated in a number of systemic reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity, nonallergic anaphylaxis, rash) and injection- and infusion-site adverse events (ISAEs; e.g., pain, erythema, thrombophlebitis). [Published by NIH: PMC PubMed Central -- online 2018 May 23. doi: 10.1007/s12325-018-0707-z]

The Material Safety Data Sheet for polysorbate 80:
• Slightly flammable to flammable in presence of heat
• Slightly hazardous in case of skin contact (irritant), of eye contact (irritant), of ingestion, of inhalation.
• May cause adverse reproductive effects based on animal test data. No human data found.
• May cause cancer based on animal test data. No human data found.
• May affect genetic material (mutagenic)

Another study: PMID: 8473002 DOI: 10.1016/0278-6915(93)90092-d from NIH's National Library of Medicine - PubMed Database, suggests a link between the ingredient and infertility in mice.  Interesting that a significant number of women who got the Covid-19 vaccine which has Polysorbate 80 in it, have lost their period and some have gone into early menopause and become infertile.

A recent study ( https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14232 ) shows a real connection between ingesting Polysorbate 80 and the development of bowel problems – it could be a real worry for those with a predisposition to Colitis.   The study concludes: "Relatively low concentrations of two commonly used emulsifiers, namely carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80, induced low-grade inflammation and obesity/metabolic syndrome in wild-type hosts and promoted robust colitis in mice predisposed to this disorder….These results support the emerging concept that perturbed host–microbiota interactions resulting in low-grade inflammation can promote adiposity and its associated metabolic effects. Moreover, they suggest that the broad use of emulsifying agents might be contributing to an increased societal incidence of obesity/metabolic syndrome and other chronic inflammatory diseases."

Another study from BMJ Journals [ https://gut.bmj.com/content/59/10/1331.full ] connected Polysorbate 80 to exacerbated Crohn’s Disease.

Crohn’s disease is common in developed nations where the typical diet is low in fibre and high in processed food. Primary lesions overlie Peyer’s patches and colonic lymphoid follicles where bacterial invasion through M-cells occurs. We have assessed the effect of soluble non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) and food emulsifiers on translocation of Escherichia coli across M-cells.

Wow.  Should we avoid Polysorbate 80?

It can be considered a concern to accept vaccines that contain the ingredient.

The choice is ultimately down to you, and while we are told that ingesting Polysorbate is not a high risk, there are certainly some worrying issues.
