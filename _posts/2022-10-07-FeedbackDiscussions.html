<p>
  Hello, everyone! I am glad to inform you that the Circularity Information Platform (CIP) evaluation session is accomplished. In this post, I share evaluation results and discussions with you.
</p>

<p>After reading this update, you will understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the research overview?</li>
  <li>What is a reference architecture model?</li>
  <li>What is the prototype design of CIP?</li>
  <li>What are the evaluation results? </li>
  <li>What do we learn from this research?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">1. What is the research overview?</h2>

<p>
  In this research, we adopt the design science research methodology. Design science is the design and investigation of prototypes in the context. We design, prototype, demonstrate, and evaluate the Reference Architecture models of CIP in the context of circular concrete supply chains. The research overview is shown in Figure 1.

<h2 class="section-heading">2. What is a reference architecture model?</h2>

<p>
  To guide the development of Information Systems, the concept of Enterprise Architecture was proposed by John Zachman in 1987. It is an enterprise engineering discipline that covers enterprise analysis, design, planning, and implementation activities. It focuses on the formal modelling of all the components that make up a complex enterprise system as well as on their inter-dependencies. Within the discipline of EA, a Reference Architecture (RA) model encompasses the knowledge about how to design robust Information system architecture by (1) capturing the essence of software architectures of specific application domains, (2) serving as standardization and evolution of the system through different development stages, and (3) reducing costs of maintenance and development of the system.
</p>

<p>
  We review the literature and develop a design blueprint for CIP in the form of RA models. The high-level integration introduces a coherent overview of CIP at the business, application, and infrastructure layers. The master model can be viewed as a solution template for the design of CIP serving a multitude of purposes, including communication, evaluation, design, and redesign of the instrument (Figure 2).

<p>
  The integrated RA model embeds the best Circular Economy (CE) industry practices and suggests optimal ICT integration. Beyond the graphical alignment, it underlines technological rules to flexibly intermediate the critical elements of construction CE at different layers through the lens of Information Systems. Notably, this is not an absolute definition of CIP but rather a structural abstraction for potential generalizations of CIP solutions.

<blockquote>
We only present an integrated overview of the RA model in this update. Note that there are another four sub-models describing the details from different perspectives, respectively.

<h2 class="section-heading">3. What is the prototype design of CIP?</h2>

<p>
  We select a circular concrete supply chain in the Twente region, the Netherlands, as the prototype context. First, we investigate a realistic problem context based on interviews with local actors, followed by a detailed analysis of the stakeholder requirement defining the functional scope. The defined functions are listed as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Function A: Support on-site Construction & Demolition Waste (CDW) information collection;</li>
  <li>Function B: Realize dynamic CDW matchmaking with efficient logistic planning;</li>
  <li>Function C: Ensure traceable & reliable information-sharing;</li>
  <li>Function D: Communicate circular construction design across life cycle phases;</li>
  <li>Function E: Create feedback channels for policy evaluation;</li>
  <li>Function F: Enable national resource monitoring & planning.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We develop a prototype of CIP for the circular concrete supply chain by Mendix. The design objectives are (1) streamlining the workflow of a circular concrete supply chain by providing different user interfaces with interviewed actors, and (2) mapping the potential roles of the identified functions on CIP. We demonstrate the artifact in Figure 3.
