description: Anurag Shanker is a third year student at NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad. He holds a keen interest in public policy, attempting to make sense of how various facets of policy making drive forward the interests of its main stakeholders - people. In his free time, he can be found cheering on his favourite team or player in any of the (frankly illogical) number of sports he follows.
