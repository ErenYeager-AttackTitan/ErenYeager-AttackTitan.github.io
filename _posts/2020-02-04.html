<p>After an intensive one month onboarding process in Toronto with Code For Canada (C4C) staff and various industry leaders, we have finally settled into Ottawa. An air of excitement and curiosity fills the building as we slowly make our way around the office to meet our new colleagues. It is immediately apparent that everyone is eager and supportive of a "Digital First" mindset and we couldn't be happier to be in such a positive environment! In the upcoming weeks, we will be quickly orienting ourselves to become more embedded into the organization, meeting all stakeholders and to quickly understand where and how we can add value to our partners. </p>
