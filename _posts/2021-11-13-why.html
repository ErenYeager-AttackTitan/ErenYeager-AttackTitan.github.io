<p>Hoi, everybody! Welcome on board!<\p>

<p>Starting from my master's graduation project, I have been connecting multiple types of key stakeholders in the concrete supply chain. Until this week, I am glad to announce that the industrial partner consortium is officially formulated and completed for my PhD project: Smart Circular Constuction Ecosystems. You can check the figure below to see what role that you would play within the project scope:</p>

<span class="caption text-muted"> Circular Business Ecosystem Based on Concrete Aggregates </span>
  
<p>There were extensive discussions about "Who is leading the group and where does this system start". Obviously, people all see their own companies as the starting point of everything with very good reasons. However, in this project, I humbly request you to think in a circular way by focusing on the fact that we all need each other to move forward and an "end" can be seen as a "start" from different perspectives. It is more important to understand how much we need each other in order to performan more complex tasks in the future. It is more important to ensure the diversity of the business ecosystem by opening windows for more new business partners. Therefore, I draw this picture in a circle without showing any traditional hierarchy between companies. When the circle is rolling because of the material flows, everybody shares equal importance.</p>

<p>The project is fundementally about systematic business ecosystem design by considering technological, economic, and societal factors. The design philosophy is going beyond the linear thinking and self-oriented mindset, towards a more transparent, collaborative, and regenerative paradigm of Smart Circular Construction Ecosystems. We aim to provide ICT-based solutions to identify, coordinate, and evaluate the business models built upon the dynamic supply-demand of secondary materials. We aim to find out a subtle balance between natural and recycled resoruces, among different industrial stakeholders, even across industrial and governmental sectors.</p>

<p>Of course, it adds more complexities to our lives. But we are also trying to address more fundamental questions in the society, which can have profound effects on our human-being’s future, isn't it?</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is interesting for you?</h2>

<p>You may have tried to tackle a problem within your own four walls. It is a particularly challenging problem and conventional thinking just isn’t cutting through it. Then circularity would be a state-of-the-art case to be a useful model to put that problem publicly and look for ideas at a much broader level with people that are not necessarily steeped in businesses as usual. So that is why the platform that we aim to develop is a powerful medium and collaborator. The Circularity Information Platform is envisaged as an open information-sharing platform where organizations share a mutual purpose and have agreed to come together, share insights, and leverage each other’s perspectives to get more diversity of thinkings as well as solutions.</p>

<p>We focus on a small and handful of companies, you. So all of you together form a key part of the circular value chain and we can start to approach the problem at a more collective level with more opportunities for changes. When one of you struggles to scale circular innovation without the wider shift in the value chain, we step in and provide essential support to explore the potential possibilities and benefits. To this end, it is important for you to have the ability to be able to zoom in and out of the picture. From tackling the very broad circular challenge by understanding the entire system, to breaking down the entire challenge into very specific challenges.<\p>
  
<p>Practically, we hope the platform can be used by all of you and help you to streamline your circular business collaborations by providing higher resource efficiency and richer economic convenience. Scientifically, you can be a representative influential network that can be recognized by scholars and practitioners all around the world. To this end, the experience and knowledge obtained from you can be potentially summarized as universal applicable principles that are valuable for the further advancement of Circular Economy at an international level.<\p>
  
<p>Once again, welcome on board, everybody!<\p>
