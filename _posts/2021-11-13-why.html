<p>Starting from my master's graduation project, I have been connecting multiple types of key stakeholders among the concrete supply chain. Until this week, I am glad to announce that the industrial partner consortium is officially formulated and completed. You can check the figure below to see what role that you play within the project scope:</p>

<p>Surely, I lost and struggled once and twice. Surely, the fact fooled me once and twice. But I shall remain the focus on what still left in my hands though I barely see any. There is no time for tears. In the cold winter bleak dawn, here I stand. My willingness alters not with his brief hours and weeks, but bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</p>
