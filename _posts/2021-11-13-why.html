<p>My beautiful youth time, my passion, and my reckless desire of being perfect despite the fact that it is impossible to be perfect. I humbly persume that I love what I am doing. Instead of naming it research, or probably I should reckon it as my cause: a principle, aim, or movement to which I am committed and which I am fully prepared to defend and advocate simultaneously. Is this a truely great love or just a tragic illusion because there is no way back?</p>
 
  
<p>Surely, I lost and struggled once and twice. Surely, the fact fooled me once and twice. But I shall remain the focus on what still left in my hands though I barely see any. There is no time for tears. In the cold winter bleak dawn, here I stand. My willingness alters not with his brief hours and weeks, but bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</p>
