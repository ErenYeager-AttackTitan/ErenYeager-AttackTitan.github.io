<p>Hello, everyone! How are you?</p>

<p>I am glad to inform you that the first stage of our PhD project is completed with two comprehensive literature reviews. This means that we find a valuable niche in academia where the scientific value of this research is highly appreciated. Now, we are moving towards the next prototype-testing stage.</p>

<p>After reading this update, you will understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What key messages are told by the literature?</li>
  <li>What is the prototype about?</li>
  <li>What is the plan for prototype testing?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">What key messages are told by the literature?</h2>

<p>The first literature review discussed the current situation of applying Information \& Communication Technologies (ICT) to support Circular Economy (CE) in the construction industry. We analysed seven types of ICT-based decision support tools developed to support complex CE-oriented tasks. The academia agreed that the research and development of ICT are important to the successful construction CE transition. However, little effort has been made to integrate relevant technologies into a comprehensive information system by considering the complex landscape of CE and the unique characteristics of the construction industry.</p>

<p>Therefore, we first summarized how these ICT-based tools support circular construction/demolition activities in different life cycle phases of a building asset. Then, we provided a conceptual reference architecture of the future information system, Circularity Information Platform (CIP), showing the potential interactions among different technologies in one digital environment. You might be familiar with Fig. 1. below if you read the research proposal.</p>



<p>Although seven types of technologies are often applied to support CE transition, we will only focus on Building Information Modelling (BIM), Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and Simulation and Modelling (SM) in the coming research because of the team’s expertise and time restriction.

<h2 class="section-heading">What is the prototype about?</h2>

<p>You may have tried to tackle a problem within your own four walls. Towards Circular Economy is a particularly wicked problem and conventional thinking just isn’t cutting through it. Developing and applying our platform, Circularity Information Platform, would be a state-of-the-art case to put that circular problem publicly and look for ideas at a much broader level with people that are not necessarily steeped in businesses as usual. That is why the platform can be a powerful medium and collaborator. The platform is envisaged as an open information-sharing platform where organizations share a mutual purpose and have agreed to come together, share insights, and leverage each other’s perspectives to get more diversity of thinkings as well as solutions.</p>

<p>We focus on a small and handful of companies, you. So all of you together form a key part of the circular value chain so that we can start to approach the problem at a more collective level with more opportunities for changes. When one of you struggles to scale circular innovation without the wider shift in the value chain, we step in and provide essential support to explore the potential possibilities and benefits. To this end, it is important for you to have the ability to be able to zoom in and out of the picture. From tackling the very broad circular challenge by understanding the entire system, to breaking down the entire challenge into very specific problems in practice.</p>
  
<p>Practically, we hope the platform can be used by all of you and help you to streamline your circular business collaborations by providing higher resource efficiency and richer economic convenience, thus, fostering the co-creation of the added value to society as a whole. Scientifically, you have a great chance to be a representative business network model that can be recognized by scholars and practitioners all around the world. In such a way, the experience and knowledge obtained from you can be potentially summarized as universal applicable principles that are valuable and influential to the further advancement of Circular Economy at an international level.</p>
