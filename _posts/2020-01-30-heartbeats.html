<p>Howdy!!! My name is Linda-Teresa Leos and I am a Technology Management Major with minors in Cybersecurity and Business.</p>

<p>In this page you will get to see what excatlly my major is. Why I am studying what I am studying. Also I am going to be listing my work history and what software I am able to work on. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Technology Management and What Excatlly It Is.</h2>

<p>Technolgoy Mamagment focuses on teaching students about computers. Specfically knowing how to work, program and manage them. This helps make sure that everyone is safe and thier data is safe as well. Understanding that computers our tools that use to collect data and make our lives easier. But they can also comprimse us in different way.</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Why I chose Technolgoy Management and My Minors</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>




<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
