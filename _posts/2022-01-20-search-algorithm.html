    In this post I am going to go through my implementation of different search algorithms 
    for path finding based on Grid map. First, I will start with the global search 
    algorithms such as breadth first and depth first. Then I will present the A* algorithms 
    and how we can optimize the code. As usual I am going to use C++ to do the programming.
</p>

<p>
    There are different type of graphs which shown in the image below. 
</p>

<p>
    In this project I define the map as a 2D vector std::vector<std::vector<Node>>. 
        The node is a class designed to have the required information such as X, Y position, 
        state if clear or wall, parent position, 
        and to check if it visited or not. Below is the code defining class.
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
class Node {
    public:
        int x, y;
        State state;
        bool visited;
    
        int parent_x;
        int parent_y;
    
        int G;
        int H;
        int cost;
    
        Node(int _x, int _y, State _state, int px, int py, int g =0, int h =0) {
            x = _x;
            y = _y;
            state = _state;
            parent_x = px;
            parent_y = py;
            visited = false;
            G = g;
            H = h;
            if (state == State::kObstecal)
            {
                cost = 255;
            }
            else
            {
                cost = 0;
            }
        }
    };
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    So, letâ€™s start talking about the search algorithms. The search algorithms is 
    used to solve the problem of problem to find the shortest path between two point. 
    There are two type of search algorithms which is uniformed search and guided algorithm.
</p>
<p>
    Uniformed search algorithm has no other information despite the start position and the goal 
position, where it searches all adjacent node until it finds the goal. There are two 
approaches we will present in this work which is the breadth-first search and depth-first 
algorithms.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection-heading">Breadth-first search</h2>
<p>
    The figure below explains how breadth-first search work by 
    explore all the adjacent node before it moves to the child of the node.
</p>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img\posts\search algorithm\breadth-first.gif">

<p>
    Every time the algorithm opens new Node it checks if the goal has been reaching or not, 
    the continue exploring the remaining. The figure below shows the algorithms steps.
</p>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img\posts\search algorithm\breadth-first algorithm.gif">

<p>
    And the code is shown below, where is it take three input and return string. 
    The input is a 2D grid, start position and the goal position. 
    I used queue to store the open node. The reason to use queue is that this data 
    structure allowed for the first in last out FILO, which save the time in organize 
    the data.
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
string BreadthFirst(vector < vector<Node>>& grid, int start[2], int goal[2]) {
    // step 1: initialize nodeList and add the start node to the list
    queue <Node> openList;
    int x = start[0];
    int y = start[1];
    AddToOpenList(x, y, 0, 0, grid, openList);
    // step 3: check if the list is empty
    while (!openList.empty())
    {
        // step 5: dequeue node as currentnode and remove it from the list
        Node currentNode = openList.front();
        // remove the first element
        openList.pop();

        x = currentNode.x;
        y = currentNode.y;
        //cout << x << "," << y << "\n";
        grid[x][y].visited = true;
        grid[x][y].state = State::kVisited;

        // step 6: check if the current node is the goal
        if (x == goal[0] && y == goal[1])
        {
            RetracePath(start, goal, grid);
            grid[start[0]][start[1]].state = State::kStart;
            grid[goal[0]][goal[1]].state = State::kFinish;
            return "Path found";
            break;
        }
        // step 7: get the neighbors of the current node
        ExpandNeighbor(currentNode, openList, grid);
    }
    return "No path Found";

}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    I wrote a functions to expand the neighbor of the current node where it check the four 
    direction of the node which top, right, bottom and left. Note that this function made as 
    a template so I can change the openList vector. 
</p>


{% highlight ruby %}
// this function used to expand the neightbor of the cuurent Node
template<class listTT>
void ExpandNeighbor(Node currentNode, listTT& openList, vector<vector<Node>>& grid) {
    int x = currentNode.x;
    int y = currentNode.y;

    for (auto neighbor : delta)
    {
        int x2 = x + neighbor[0];
        int y2 = y + neighbor[1];
        if (CheckValidCell(x2, y2, grid) == 1)
        {
            AddToOpenList(x2, y2, x, y, grid, openList);
            grid[x2][y2].state = State::kVisited;
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    CheckValidCell is another function used to test if the node is accessible. 
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
bool CheckValidCell(int x, int y, std::vector<std::vector<Node>>& grid) 
{
    bool on_grid_x = (x >= 0 && x < grid.size());
    bool on_grid_y = (y >= 0 && y < grid[0].size());
    if (on_grid_x && on_grid_y) 
    {
        State nodeState = grid[x][y].state;
        if (nodeState != State::kObstecal && grid[x][y].visited == false)
        {
            return grid[x][y].state == State::kEmpty;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    AddToOpenList is function designed 
    to add the node into openList due to the complexity of node class.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
template <class listT>
void AddToOpenList(int x, int y, int p_x, int p_y, vector<vector<Node>>& grid, listT& openList) {
    Node currentNode{ x, y, State::kClose, p_x, p_y };
    openList.push(currentNode);
    grid[x][y].parent_x = p_x;
    grid[x][y].parent_y = p_y;
    grid[x][y].state = State::kClose;
}    
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    And finally, we have the function to trace the path from finish to start. 
    Here we will see why we define the parent for each node. 
    Every current node expands four new node where the current node will be the 
    parent of these node.
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
vector<Node> RetracePath(int startNode[2], int goal[2], vector<vector<Node>>& grid)
    {
        vector<Node> path;
        Node currentNode = grid[goal[0]][goal[1]];
        int x = currentNode.x;
        int y = currentNode.y;
        while (x != startNode[0] || y != startNode[1])
        {
            path.push_back(currentNode);
            grid[currentNode.x][currentNode.y].state = State::kPath;
            currentNode = grid[currentNode.parent_x][currentNode.parent_y];
            x = currentNode.x;
            y = currentNode.y;
        }
    
        reverse(path.begin(), path.end());
        cout << "Path length: " << path.size() << "\n";
        return path;
    }
    
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    The second uniformed search is the depth-first where it explores the depth of 
    every node before it goes it its neighbor. The figure below shows the search of 
    the depth first.
</p>

<h2 class="sybsection-heading">Depth-first search</h2>

<p>
    The second uniformed search is the depth-first where it explores the depth of 
    every node before it goes it its neighbor. The figure below shows the search of 
    the depth first.
</p>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img\posts\search algorithm\depth First.gif">

<p>
    The figure below shows the steps of depth first algorithm which follow the same steps.
</p>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img\posts\search algorithm\depth First algorithm.gif">

<p>
    The below code shows the function of the depth first algorithms that has the same
     input of breadth-first and the same output. But these algorithms use stack to store 
     the open list. The reason to use stack because stack worked based on the first in first
      out FIFO.
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
string DepthFirst(vector<vector<Node>>& grid, int start[2], int goal[2]) {
    // step 1: initialize openList and add that start node
    stack <Node> openList;
    int x = start[0];
    int y = start[1];
    AddToOpenList(x, y, 0, 0, grid, openList);

    // step 2: check iof open list is not empty
    while (!openList.empty())
    {
        // step 3: get the currentNode from the stack 
        Node currentNode = openList.top();
        openList.pop();
        x = currentNode.x;
        y = currentNode.y;
        //cout << x << "," << y << "\n";
        // step 4: mark the node as visited
        grid[x][y].visited = true;
        grid[x][y].state = State::kVisited;
        // step 5: check if the node is the goal
        if (x == goal[0] && y == goal[1])
        {
            RetracePath(start, goal, grid);
            grid[start[0]][start[1]].state = State::kStart;
            grid[goal[0]][goal[1]].state = State::kFinish;
            return "[INFO] path was found...";
            break;
        }

        // step 6: check the neighbor of the node
        ExpandNeighbor(currentNode, openList, grid);
    }
    return " [INFO] No path was found...";
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
    The output is show below of both the breadth-first and the depth-first. 
    As can be seen that the number of nodes explored is shown in purple and 
    the bath is shown in green and the yellow is the wall.
</p>

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img\posts\search algorithm\output_breadth-depth.PNG">

<p>
    As can be seen in the output that the explore in both methods are different 
    due to the nature of the explore way. Both algorithms able to reach the path but the 
    final path length is different also the number of node explore differe.
</p>

<h2 class="sybsection-heading">A star Algorithm</h2>
<p>
    Now we are going to use a heuristic function algorithm that use measure to chose the shortest path with minimum exploring nodes.
    What we mean by heuristic function is that the algorithm use information such as the moving cost, 
    and the distance from the current node to the goal then decided on which node move. The same step node based on 
    the cost function. In this work we used the smallerst to largest.
</p>

<p>
    Revisiting the Node class there are two variable that we did not used in the uniformed search which is 
    H and G. Where H represent the distance between the node and the gaol and we measure it using euclidean distance.
    And G is the move cost which is accomulated from the start node to the current node. 
</p>
<p>
    We update the expandNeighbors function by adding the measurment of heuristic and compute the cost movement.

<h2 class="sybsection-heading">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    As can be seen there are two type of search algorithms which uninformed search and informed search.
    In the uniformed search the expolation occur unguided which based on which node to explore first, 
    while the informed search algorithm it used information and heuristic function. 
</p>

<p>
    Overall, the step of applying the algorithms is same but using different type of data structures
    simplified the implementation process.
