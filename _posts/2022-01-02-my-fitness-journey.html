<strong>You only know yourself when you go beyond your limits”</strong>

— Paulo Coelho

<p>Well… Let’s get into the story (this is going to be a long one). I was always a fat kid, a big-time foodie since the beginning. I had been involved in yoga (thanks to my dad ❤) and some sort of physical activities on and off in school days. I was born fat. Yes, I weighed around 4.5 kgs when I was born, and I never remember looking like ordinary or thin people around me. I often used to get bullied. Body shaming had become a regular thing for me. You don’t like to get your pictures clicked when you are fat, and this usually has been the case with me. I always tried to avoid photographs, gatherings, etc.<p>
