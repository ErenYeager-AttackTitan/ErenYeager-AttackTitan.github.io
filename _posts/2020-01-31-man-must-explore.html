<p>The page I made to learn Git during my first week at Tagger!</p>
<p>Here is some basic facts about me! I am going to be a senior at a boarding school in Watertown, Connecticut called Taft School but I live just outside of San Francisco, California. I have a younger brother and sister named Oliver and Ella who also are in high school and go to boarding school. At Taft I am the captian of the Varsity Ski team and the starting goalie on the Varsity Lacrosse team. I also play JV Field Hockey on my off season for fun. When I am home I love to surf, hike and mountain bike. I spend my summers up in Michigan where I love to just be on the water ans wakesurf.</p>
