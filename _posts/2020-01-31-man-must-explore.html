<p>The page I made to learn Git!</p>
<p>Here is some basic facts about me! I am going to be a senior at a boarding school in Watertown, Connecticut called Taft School but I live just outside of San Francisco, California. I have a younger brother and sister named Oliver and Ella who also are in high school and go to boarding school. At Taft I am the captian of the Varsity Ski team and the starting goalie on the Varsity Lacrosse team. I also play JV Field Hockey on my off season for fun. When I am home I love to surf, hike and mountain bike. I spend my summers up in Michigan where I love to just be on the water ans wakesurf.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
