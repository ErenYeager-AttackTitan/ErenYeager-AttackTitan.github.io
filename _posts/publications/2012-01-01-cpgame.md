abstract: Emergencies and disasters require multiple agencies to collaborate at different levels in order to respond effectively. This involves a thorough understanding of the collaborating agenciesâ€™ standard operating procedures and ensuring that protocols are followed for inter-agency communication. The paper-based game described below allows us to explore the complexity of collaboration among different agencies, while mitigating a hypothetical disaster situation simulated with necessary conditions. We then present future modifications to the game and insights from trial runs.
