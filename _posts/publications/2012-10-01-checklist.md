abstract: Certain medical and para-medical procedures require the responsible personnel to follow checklists so that small but key steps are not missed. Checklists need to be small, precise and easy to internalise. However, training through mock drills for such procedures is often expensive and/or time consuming. Games can provide the platform to repeat exercises, provide alternate scenarios and they have the potential to scale. Game based learning and training can be used in conjunction with theory-based learning and it can help increase effectiveness of the mock exercises. Games leverage role-playing to reinforce learning. Here we present two examples of check-list based games for training that were developed after a need was expressed by the medical personnel during a mock exercise. The first one is a game to train paramedics in the process of Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). CPR is an emergency procedure performed by trained personnel to maintain brain function in an unresponsive person, until the patient can be given full medical care. Multiple agencies such as the Resuscitation Council (UK) and the American Heart Association have slightly varying standards for CPR. Also, the standards themselves vary a lot over time. Game Based Training in such instances add huge value by providing a platform where such changes can be quickly incorporated and deployed to train personnel. The second example is of Triage, which is a procedure to 'tag' victims on an incident as either Red, Blue, Green or Black based on the priorities in which they have to be treated. Paramedics usually have 30 seconds per victim to tag them. This requires them to internalise the procedures. We will present how game based training can be used for Triage by giving an example of a prototype game.
