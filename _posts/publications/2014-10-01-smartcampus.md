abstract: Any large organisation spanning multiple buildings and locations faces the complex problem of managing resources and services in an effective, sustainable and reliable manner. In order to do so, it is important to approach the problem from a behavioural, technical and policy aspects. To begin with, we consider electricity as one resource in the campus of an educational institute. In this paper we describe our approach to model a university campus as a socio-technical system and demonstrate the model through a prototype. In the model, agents in the campus attempt to distribute the load based on these parameters while simultaneously attempting to save electricity. Using the simulation we present the results for multiple scenarios of operation ranging from business-as-usual to a conservative system in the IIIT Bangalore campus.
