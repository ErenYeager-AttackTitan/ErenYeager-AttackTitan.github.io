book: An Eviction Impact Assessment of Ejipura/Koramangala Four Years After its Demolition
title: Bengaluru's Continuing Inequality
abstract: Amidst the all-encompassing enthusiasm for growth and progress, the rapid pace of urbanization in India brings with it the challenges of inequality and inequity, including those related to dispossession and displacement of the urban poor, which need to be addressed. The city government of Bengaluru forcibly evicted over 1,500 families from Ejipura/Koramangala in January 2013. A human rights-based 'Eviction Impact Assessment' study was carried out between June and August 2015. The study was a collaborative effort of Housing and Land Rights Network, Delhi; Forum against EWS Land Grab, Bengaluru; and, Fields of View, Bengaluru. This report presents the findings of the study, documents the current living conditions of the displaced families four years after their forced eviction, and presents recommendations to the Government of Karnataka.<br><br>To be released on 29th July 2017.<br><br>Collaborators&#58; <a href="http://hlrn.org.in/">Housing and Land Rights Network</a>, Forum against EWS Land Grab.
