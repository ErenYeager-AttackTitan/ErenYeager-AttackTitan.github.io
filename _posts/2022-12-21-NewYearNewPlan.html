<blockquote> "“Celebrate endings, for they precede new beginnings.” 
 —Jonathan Lockwood Huie, author</blockquote>

<p>
Hi, everyone! I am glad to share this update with you at the end of the year 2022.
</p>

<p>
The major outcome of the past year is that we proposed the architecture of the online information platform, Circularity Information Platform. Our vision is one step clearer:
</p>

<p><b>
“Create a digital collaborative space for Circular Economy in the built environment.”
  </b>
</p>

<p>
Standing on the basic structure of the platform, we expect multiple directions for future research. One of the most important directions is <b> waste-to-resource matchmaking </b>. In the upcoming phase of the PhD program, we will investigate this matchmaking function as a decision-support component for the platform.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">1. (De-)Construction Matchmaking: An Inclusive Approach to Circular Economy</h2>

<p>
Following the concept of urban mining, Demolition Waste (DW) can be a valuable resource for other projects. Various waste-to-resource interactions occur across heterogeneous projects, which may lead to the emergence of a broader circular ecosystem. The process of creating and sustaining such an interaction among multiple actors is also known as DW matchmaking. Theoretically, the reuse of building elements can reduce both new production and waste, and it is prioritised over recycling due to limited reprocessing consumption. However, recycling is inevitable in the built environment because of traditional construction methods and certain material characteristics. Therefore, DW matchmaking can be considered as an inclusive process to enhance End-of-Life DW management by exploring more circular pathways.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Reduce or Avoid should be first considered before Reuse or Recycle because of its prioritised hierarchy in the theoretical framework. However, given the current skyrocketing demand of the construction market and the rigid designs of most existing constructions, it would be wise to narrow down our research scope. Therefore, we decide to first lay down the fundamental digital infrastructure for closing-loop practices. With a healthy closed-loop foundation, we suggest future research on narrowing and slowing the loop. Therefore, we focus on closed-loop supply chain development, particularly, connecting forward and reverse supply chains, in the coming study. 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">2. Reverse Supply Chain Development: Key Actors and Their Interactions</h2>

<p>
The basic setup of actors and their interactions in a reverse supply chain is depicted in Fig. 1. First, the direct reuse process starts with the decision to dismantle EoL buildings. Through deconstruction, valuable materials and components salvaged by the demolition team might be directly reused in new construction without reprocessing nor transportation, e.g. on-site urban mining. However, it is challenging to ensure demand for direct reuse immediately upon dismantling due to unclear CE requirements for a new building and the underdeveloped market for secondary materials. In this regard, storage facilities, namely, <b>waste transfer stations</b>, are required to offer temporary storage and sorting services until suitable demand emerges or sufficient quantity is accumulated for economical deals.
