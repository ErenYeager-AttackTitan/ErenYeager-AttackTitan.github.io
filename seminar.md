## About The Seminar

This seminar takes place every Friday, at a suitable time and is meant for talks by young Assamese mathematicians (PhD Students, Postdocs, and young faculty members). If you wish to attend or give a talk in the seminar please email me (manjil@gonitsora.com). 

All the talks will be over Zoom and the meeting details will be emailed to the registered participants.

<summary>26 June, 2020 (8 pm IST): Autocommuting Probability of finite groups (Dr. Parama Dutta, Lahimpur Girls' College)</summary>
Let G be a finite group and Aut(G) the automorphism group of G. The
autocommuting probability of G, denoted by Pr(G; Aut(G)), is the probability
that a randomly chosen automorphism of G fixes a randomly chosen element of
G. In the talk, we study Pr(G; Aut(G)) through certain computing formula and
bounds. We also discuss certain characterizations of G through Pr(G; Aut(G)).

<summary>17 July, 2020 (5 pm IST): Families of Congruences for Fractional Partition Functions Modulo Powers of Primes (Hirakjyoti Das, Tezpur University)</summary>
Recently, Chan and Wang (Fractional powers of the generating function for the partition function.
Acta Arith. 187(1), 59--80 (2019)) studied the fractional powers of the generating function for the partition
function and found several congruences satisfied by the corresponding coefficients. In this talk, we find
some new families of congruences modulo powers of primes. We also find analogous results for the coefficients
of the fractional powers of the generating function for the 2-color partition function.
