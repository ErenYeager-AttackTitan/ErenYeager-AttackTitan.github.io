## About The Seminar

This seminar takes place usually on Fridays, at a suitable time and is meant for talks by young Assamese mathematicians (PhD Students, Postdocs, and young faculty members). If you wish to attend or give a talk in the seminar please email me (manjil@gonitsora.com) or Parama Dutta (parama@gonitsora.com).

Check the [FAQs](#faqs).

All the talks will be over Zoom and the meeting details will be emailed to the registered participants.

## Next Talk

**Hypergeometric Series over Finite Fields**

**Arjun Singh Chetry (IIIT, Guwahati)**

**10 July 2020 (8 pm IST)**

**Abstract**: Hypergeometric series are special functions which find its applications in numerous branch of mathematics. In this talk, we shall visualize this function from a number-theoretic point of view. In 1987, John Greene developed a character sum analogue of the binomial theorem and binomial coeficients, and as a result, finite field analogue for the hypergeometric series was established. Analogous to the classical series, hypergeometric series over finite fields satisfy many summation and transformation formulas. We shall look into some of them.

<summary><b>17 July, 2020 (5 pm IST)</b>: Families of Congruences for Fractional Partition Functions Modulo Powers of Primes (<b>Hirakjyoti Das</b>, Tezpur University)</summary>

Recently, Chan and Wang (Fractional powers of the generating function for the partition function. Acta Arith. 187(1), 59--80 (2019)) studied the fractional powers of the generating function for the partition function and found several congruences satisfied by the corresponding coefficients. In this talk, we find some new families of congruences modulo powers of primes. We also find analogous results for the coefficients of the fractional powers of the generating function for the 2-color partition function.
