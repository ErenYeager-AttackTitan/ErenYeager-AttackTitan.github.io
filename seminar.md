## About The Seminar

This seminar takes place usually on Fridays, at a suitable time and is meant for talks by young Assamese mathematicians (PhD Students, Postdocs, and young faculty members). If you wish to attend or give a talk in the seminar please email me (manjil@gonitsora.com).

Check the [FAQs](#faqs).

All the talks will be over Zoom and the meeting details will be emailed to the registered participants.

## Next Talk

**Autocommuting Probability of finite groups**  

**Parama Dutta (Lakhimpur Girls' College)**

**26 July 2020 (8 pm IST)**

**Abstract**: Let G be a finite group and Aut(G) the automorphism group of G. The autocommuting probability of G, denoted by Pr(G; Aut(G)), is the probability that a randomly chosen automorphism of G fixes a randomly chosen element of G. In the talk, we study Pr(G; Aut(G)) through certain computing formula and bounds. We also discuss certain characterizations of G through Pr(G; Aut(G)).

<summary><b>10 July, 2020</b>: Hypergeometric Series over Finite Fields (<b>Arjun Singh Chetry</b>, IIIT Guwahati)</summary>

Hypergeometric series are special functions which find its applications in numerous branch of mathematics. In this talk, we shall visualize this function from a number-theoretic point of view. In 1987, John Greene developed a character sum analogue of the binomial theorem and binomial coeficients, and as a result, finite field analogue for the hypergeometric series was established. Analogous to the classical series, hypergeometric series over finite fields satisfy many summation and transformation formulas. We shall look into some of them.

<summary><b>17 July, 2020 (5 pm IST)</b>: Families of Congruences for Fractional Partition Functions Modulo Powers of Primes (<b>Hirakjyoti Das</b>, Tezpur University)</summary>

Recently, Chan and Wang (Fractional powers of the generating function for the partition function. Acta Arith. 187(1), 59--80 (2019)) studied the fractional powers of the generating function for the partition function and found several congruences satisfied by the corresponding coefficients. In this talk, we find some new families of congruences modulo powers of primes. We also find analogous results for the coefficients of the fractional powers of the generating function for the 2-color partition function.
