<summary>26 June, 2020 (8 pm IST): Autocommuting Probability of finite groups (Dr. Parama Dutta, Lahimpur Girls' College)</summary>
Let G be a finite group and Aut(G) the automorphism group of G. The
autocommuting probability of G, denoted by Pr(G; Aut(G)), is the probability
that a randomly chosen automorphism of G fixes a randomly chosen element of
G. In the talk, we study Pr(G; Aut(G)) through certain computing formula and
bounds. We also discuss certain characterizations of G through Pr(G; Aut(G)).
