I have noticed that I spent more time than is necessary checking and answering or filing emails. So to streamline this process for me and also to not waste time I have decided to segregate my emails.

If you wish to email me regarding my **official work at Cardiff**, then please use my office email id: **SaikiaM[at]cardiff.ac.uk**. (*I check this email account everyday and reply to emails at least once everyday.*)

If you wish to email me regarding my **work at [Gonit Sora](https://gonitsora.com)**, then please use my Gonit Sora email id: **manjil[at]gonitsora.com**. (*I check this email account everyday and reply to emails at least once everyday.*) If you are submitting an article for publication there, then please send it to **editor[at]gonitsora.com**. (*I check this email account once every few days and reply to emails as soon as I see them.*) If you are interested in our events, then please email **events[at]gonitsora.com**. (*I check this email account once every few days and reply to emails as soon as I see them.*)

If you wish to email me regarding any **other work related to mathematics or academics**, then please use my personal email id: **manjil[at]saikia.in**. (*I check this email account once every two days and reply to emails as soon as I see them.*)

If you wish to email me regarding any **other work NOT related to mathematics or academics**, then please use my personal email id: **mailme[at]manjilsaikia.in**. (*I check this email account once every two days and reply to emails as soon as I see them.*)

If your email is **not related to any work** at all, then please email me at **manjil[at]gonitsora.org**. (*I check this email account very rarely and reply only if I have time.*)

*I now segregate my email replies as well, so you might receive a reply from a different email id than the one that you sent your email to.*
