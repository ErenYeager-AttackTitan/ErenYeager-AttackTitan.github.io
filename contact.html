<p>If you have questions, or just want to say hi (like signing a guestbook), please use the Disqus comment widget below.</p>
<p>For quesions please do at least 5 minutes of research on Google before you ask. Also, why not to introduce yourself and I'd highly recommend punctuation. If your message is hard to read, I will not take the time to answer your question.</p>
