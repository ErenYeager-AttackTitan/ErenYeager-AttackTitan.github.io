  heading: Geography of Industrialisation
  description: <p class="simple-content">This month, we present a talk on ‘Geography of Industrialisation’ by Dr. Sharadini Rath, Affiliate Fellow, Indian School of Political Economy, Pune, who has worked on various areas of urban and rural governance.</p><p class="simple-content">It is taken as a given that industrialisation and urbanisation go hand in hand.Agglomeration formations, like Chennai or Pune, have long histories of such symbiotic behaviour and are able to leverage those embedded processes in times economic upturns to register further growth, in cumulative cycles. But for India, the focus on such large agglomerations, or metros, have resulted in severe regional imbalances in the creation of industrial employment. The talk will present evidence of this for Maharashtra, and some case studies to throw light on how individual industrial locations behave over a period, and what the drivers for industrial decision making might be.</p>

  heading: Koogu
  description: <p class="simple-content">Koogu, the Kannada word for 'call' or 'shout', is a solo performance comprising of a series of vignettes based on real events, some that occurred in the performer's life - a grandmother who considered dancing 'cheap', memories of a church choir, an attempt to run the marathon - all examined in the light of larger ideas of freedom, culture and tradition.</p><p class="simple-content">The performance was born out of a series of conversations between a Bengaluru-based theatre worker, Anish Victor and Michel Casanovas, a dancer and choreographer from France. The dialogue revolved around the question - 'what does one stand and fight for?' Employing a non-linear narrative - Koogu uses text, dance, sound, song and music in order to provide the audience fresh ways of sensing and engaging with performance.</p><p class="simple-content">Having performed in diverse venues - living rooms, terraces, kitchens, office-spaces, basements, a Sal forest, as well as regular auditoriums - across Bangalore, Kolkata, New Delhi, Assam, Chennai, Pondicherry and Kenya - Koogu continues its journey.</p><p class="simple-content">Sandbox Collective is a performance collective comprising of artists and arts managers led by Nimi Ravindran and Shiva Pathak, both of whom have worked in the theatre for over 15 years. Sandbox works towards enhancing the scope of performing arts and to towards creating more cultural vibrant cities. Besides performing all our plays in auditorium, as well as in alternative spaces like offices, homes, basements, restaurants and and terraces, (in a bit to reach out to the non-theatre going audience) we also use theatre and performance for various other purposes including education, training and in resolving conflict(of various kinds). Sandbox Collective also curates and organizes theatre and performance festivals and tours plays in India and abroad.</p>

  heading: Why are Bangalore's lakes foaming?
  description: It is all over the news, these photographs of a foaming lake. Motorists complain, petitions are being filed, ordinary people are horrified, and the international media too has taken note. But why are these lakes foaming? Some Government officials said it is because of household waste. Some say it seems like industrial effluents. There seem to be a lot of perspectives, but not much clarity. And so, in this month’s Research in Play, we aim to explore the question why. Why are Bangalore’s lakes foaming? Between October 19th - 23th, we hope to have a team join us in exploring this question. You will undertake both desk and field research and analyse your findings. These findings will be presented at a public event in the FoV House during the last week of October.
