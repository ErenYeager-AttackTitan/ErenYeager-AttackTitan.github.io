  heading: A Tale of Complexity - Poverty, Income and Well-being
  when: 6 PM, 20th January (Friday)
  description: <p class="simple-content">The recent Oxfam report on inequality paints a grim picture of India. It is often assumed that improving income/wages will result in a greater quality of life. The Universal Basic Income flows from the same idea. Meanwhile, there has been a shift in conceptualizing poverty in an interconnected manner, rather than in a reductive way. This begs the question whether the relationship between income/wages and well-being is linear. It is in this context, Bharath will discuss his approach in modeling the complex and dynamic relationship between income/wages and well-being, and the potential computational approaches offer in creating such models. This could lead to a better understanding of the factors that need to be addressed in designing policies to address poverty.</p><p class="simple-content">Bharath M. Palavalli designs games and simulations to understand complex adaptive systems. He is currently working on identifying and understanding the conflict prone relationship between the urban poor and the city; specifically, to help in policy design and planning in a rapidly urbanizing context of developing countries. Previously, he has designed agent based simulation frameworks, and games for safety and learning.</p>

  heading: Just-so Streets
  when: 6 PM, 2nd December (Friday)
  description: <p class="simple-content">For this Research in Play,  Morgan Campbell, Doctoral Candidate of Urban Planning and Public Policy and recent resident of Bengaluru invites conversations that link together questions, reflections, and experiences related to gender, transportation, and [the idea of] collective space.</p><p class="simple-content">Morgan will introduce the research and thought process that informs her doctoral work and led to her recent Gender Bender project of working with the BMTC women bus conductors, some initial findings, and why the interior spaces of public transportation are as important to study as the transport systems themselves.</p><p class="simple-content">Morgan requests attendees to come prepared to discuss the collective space within public transportation, what that collective space looks like in different cities, and Bengaluru in particular.</p><p class="simple-content">Morgan Campbell is a doctoral candidate of urban planning working at the intersection of planning and critical theory to interrogate the various ways in which urban mobility, particularly transportation mobility, literally and symbolically moves (and occasionally removes) gender differences. She has lived New York, France, Japan, and England but now calls Bengaluru home.</p>

  heading: We Must Risk Delight - What the Stories of Mahila Samakhya Tell Us.
  when: 6 PM, 5th August (Friday)
  description: <p class="simple-content">We must risk delight. We can do without pleasure, </br>but not delight. Not enjoyment. We must have</br>the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless</br>furnace of this world....</br>- Jack Gilbert</p><p class="simple-content">Mahila Samakhya, one of the world's largest state-funded women’s empowerment programme, creates spaces where women can reflect, examine, articulate, and situate their problems and experiences within their own context. Women, as a collective, create spaces to strategise, resolve, tackle, and address individual and broader problems. In a previous talk given at the Alternative Law Forum, Dr. Niveditha Menon, from the Centre for Budget and Policy Studies, spoke about the stories of Mahila Samakhya – stories that conveyed the laughter, the tears, the solidarity, the resistance, and the commitment of Mahila Samakhya women.</p><p class="simple-content">In this month's edition of Research in Play, she will revisit the concept with an emphasis on examining the philosophy and practice of Mahila Samakhya with stories, anecdotes, photographs, and short clips. Niveditha will talk about how the power of storytelling is infused in the research of Mahila Samakhya, and how ordinary observations are made extraordinary with the mere act of self-reflection. In essence, she will be telling the story of Mahila Samakhya through the stories of its women – a story of struggle, survival and stubborn hope.</p>

  heading: The Hybrid Domain - Collaborative Governance for Social Innovation
  when: 5 30 PM, 24th June (Friday)
  description: <p class="simple-content">As part of our Research in Play series, we present a talk on ‘Collaborative Governance for Social Innovation’ by Dr. Balaji Parthasarathy of IIIT-B.</p><p class="simple-content">To explore new possibilities to solve some of the most pressing social challenges of the 21st century, this talk will explore the hybrid domain as an emerging institutional form to generate social innovation.</p><p class="simple-content">The shifting relations between states, markets, not-for-profit sectors, and technology shape the landscape for social innovation. The empowerment of low-income populations in India in particular, and in the Global South in general, as contributors of knowledge for social innovation promises developmental impacts that earlier efforts could not deliver. Particularly in the context of state failure to deliver services that fulfill the basic needs of citizens, collaborative governance can serve as an useful alternative to blend economic and social objectives by overriding organizational boundaries which were previously considered ideologically incompatible and, therefore, unbridgeable.</p><p class="simple-content">Dr. Balaji Parthasarathy is on the faculty of the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore. His professional interests lie at the intersection of technological innovation, economic globalization, and social change, especially in underprivileged contexts.</p>

  heading: Street Vendors Act of 2014 - An unfolding of contemporary history
  when: 6 PM, 5th May (Thursday)
  description: <p class="simple-content">As part of our Research in Play series, we present a talk on ‘Street Vendors Act of 2014’ by Vinay Sreenivasa of Alternative Law Forum.</p><p class="simple-content">Streets are said to be a city's vital organs, yet our cities' streets are contested spaces. There are differing views competing with each other on what should be the nature of our cities' streets, who can and should occupy them, and how they will be shaped in the future.</p><p class="simple-content">In this context, the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulating Street Vending) Act of 2014, came into effect on March 5th, 2015. The law is to both protect livelihoods and ensure regulation of vending in a democratic manner, with the involvement of the Street Vendors.</p><p class="simple-content">What are the implications of this new law? What insights does the unfolding process of implementing this law provide us? What are the issues and challenges?</p><p class="simple-content">Vinay not only has had a ringside view, but also is an active participant as someone who has been campaigning for street vendor rights much before the law came into being. On Thursday, Vinay will share with us the story of the journey thus far, and how these debates could shape the fiercely debated space that is our streets.</p>

  heading: Geography of Industrialisation
  description: <p class="simple-content">This month, we present a talk on ‘Geography of Industrialisation’ by Dr. Sharadini Rath, Affiliate Fellow, Indian School of Political Economy, Pune, who has worked on various areas of urban and rural governance.</p><p class="simple-content">It is taken as a given that industrialisation and urbanisation go hand in hand.Agglomeration formations, like Chennai or Pune, have long histories of such symbiotic behaviour and are able to leverage those embedded processes in times economic upturns to register further growth, in cumulative cycles. But for India, the focus on such large agglomerations, or metros, have resulted in severe regional imbalances in the creation of industrial employment. The talk will present evidence of this for Maharashtra, and some case studies to throw light on how individual industrial locations behave over a period, and what the drivers for industrial decision making might be.</p>

  heading: Koogu
  description: <p class="simple-content">Koogu, the Kannada word for 'call' or 'shout', is a solo performance comprising of a series of vignettes based on real events, some that occurred in the performer's life - a grandmother who considered dancing 'cheap', memories of a church choir, an attempt to run the marathon - all examined in the light of larger ideas of freedom, culture and tradition.</p><p class="simple-content">The performance was born out of a series of conversations between a Bengaluru-based theatre worker, Anish Victor and Michel Casanovas, a dancer and choreographer from France. The dialogue revolved around the question - 'what does one stand and fight for?' Employing a non-linear narrative - Koogu uses text, dance, sound, song and music in order to provide the audience fresh ways of sensing and engaging with performance.</p><p class="simple-content">Having performed in diverse venues - living rooms, terraces, kitchens, office-spaces, basements, a Sal forest, as well as regular auditoriums - across Bangalore, Kolkata, New Delhi, Assam, Chennai, Pondicherry and Kenya - Koogu continues its journey.</p><p class="simple-content">Sandbox Collective is a performance collective comprising of artists and arts managers led by Nimi Ravindran and Shiva Pathak, both of whom have worked in the theatre for over 15 years. Sandbox works towards enhancing the scope of performing arts and to towards creating more cultural vibrant cities. Besides performing all our plays in auditorium, as well as in alternative spaces like offices, homes, basements, restaurants and and terraces, (in a bit to reach out to the non-theatre going audience) we also use theatre and performance for various other purposes including education, training and in resolving conflict(of various kinds). Sandbox Collective also curates and organizes theatre and performance festivals and tours plays in India and abroad.</p>

  heading: Why are Bangalore's lakes foaming?
  description: It is all over the news, these photographs of a foaming lake. Motorists complain, petitions are being filed, ordinary people are horrified, and the international media too has taken note. But why are these lakes foaming? Some Government officials said it is because of household waste. Some say it seems like industrial effluents. There seem to be a lot of perspectives, but not much clarity. And so, in this month’s Research in Play, we aim to explore the question why. Why are Bangalore’s lakes foaming? Between October 19th - 23th, we hope to have a team join us in exploring this question. You will undertake both desk and field research and analyse your findings. These findings will be presented at a public event in the FoV House during the last week of October.
