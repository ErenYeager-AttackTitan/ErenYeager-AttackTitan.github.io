Since 2008, I have been invited to deliver talks to mathematical Olympiad aspirants at various places. I thought it would be a good idea to collect all the problem sheets from those talks at one place. Some of these sheets have been distributed in other websites as well and they have been well received. I do not claim much originality, almost all the problems in these sheets can be found elsewhere. I have made references in most of the places, for others where references are not found, I apologize for this lapse on my part.

I delivered a talk in September 2008 at Kaliabor College on [Geometry](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/kaliabor/On%20some%20simple%20Geometrical%20applications.pdf).

In July 2011 I gave a series of talks at Darrang College, Tezpur for school students who were interested in Olympiads. The files are here: [Inequalities](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/darrang/ineq.pdf), [Number Theory Lecture Notes](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/darrang/darrang_lecture.pdf), [Number Theory Problem Sheet 1](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/darrang/problem-sheet.pdf), [Problem Sheet 2](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/darrang/problems-nt.pdf) and [Problem Sheet 3](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/darrang/cat-I.pdf).

In January and February 2012 I gave a few talks at Gauhati University, Guwahati and North Eastern Hill University (NEHU), Shillong in a Pre Indian National Mathematical Olympiad (INMO) training camp. The files are here: [Geometry](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/2012/geometry.pdf), [Mathematical Induction](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/2012/mathematical-induction.pdf), [Pigeon Hole Principle](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/2012/pigeon-hole-principle.pdf) and [Number Theory](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/2012/number-theory.pdf).

In August 2012 I gave some talks for higher secondary students at Kaliabor College on [inequalities](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/kaliabor/inequalities.pdf) and [polynomials](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/kaliabor/polynomials.pdf).

In January and February 2013 I gave a few talks at Gauhati University, Guwahati and NEHU, Shillong in a Pre INMO training camp. The files are here: [Inequalities](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/2013/ineq.pdf) and [Number Theory](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/2013/nt.pdf).

In April 2013, I gave a talk on [geometry](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/geometry_tinisukia.pdf) for school students at Womens College, Tinisukia.

In August 2013 I gave two talks for higher secondary students at Kalibor College on [combinations](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/kaliabor/combinations.pdf) (this file is missing some problems, unfortunately I do not have the final version).

In January and February 2014 I gave a few talks at Gauhati University, Guwahati and NEHU, Shillong in a Pre INMO training camp. The files are here: [Combinatorics](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/2014/ghy_counting.pdf), [Functional Equations](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/2014/func_eqns.pdf), [Polynomials](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/2014/poly.pdf), [Geometry](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/2014/geometry.pdf) and [Assorted Problems](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/2014/2014_problems.pdf).

In July 2014 I gave a few talks at Darrang College, Tezpur on Number Theory. The sketch notes are available [here](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/2014/number-theory-darrang.pdf).

In 2017, I made a few question papers for my sister who was about to appear for her high school leaving examination. These can be found [here](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/aitu-1.pdf) and [here](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/aitu-2.pdf).

In 2018, I was invited to give a few lectures for aspirants of CMI and ISI entrance examinations. I made a problem sheet for them, which can be found [here](http://gonitsora.com/manjil/olympiads/inspire.pdf).

In December 2022, I gave a problem solving session for JEE aspirants at IIIT Manipur. Some of the problems discussed can be found [here](/Downloads/iiit-jee.pdf).
