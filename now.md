I'm in London, working towards releasing the a big update to the [Mainframe app](https://mainframe.com/),
still very much in love with [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).

Learning to play [go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) from
[Nick Sibicky's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/nicksibicky) and some brilliant books, trying to overcome
[ladder anxiety](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ladder+anxiety&defid=7429733)
when playing on [OGS](https://online-go.com/) ;)
