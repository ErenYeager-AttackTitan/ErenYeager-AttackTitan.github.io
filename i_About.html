      <h2>Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Tao and I am looking for <b>data/business</b> analyst position currently. I hold
        a Bechelor's degree in mathematics (Information and Computing Science with data analysis track, <a href="http://english.whut.edu.cn">Wuhan
        University of Technology</a>) and a Master's degree in science (Business Analytics, <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk">University of Exeter</a>).</p>
      <p>Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So that's how I look at data sets: they are
         big puzzles and once they are been solved, you will get rewards in business. Finding secrets nobody else sees 
        is the challenge to me.</p>
      <p>Before I studied my postgradute degree, I had worked for one year as a marketing analyst. I have worked for 5 
        companies and orgnisations which gives me the ability to translate complex questions into understand insights.
      </p> 
      <p>Do you want to work together? Please reach out to me by <a href="mailto:dylan.wt@outlook.com">Email</a> or 
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taowu3/">Linkedin</a>.</p>
