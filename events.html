  title: Research In Play - 12
  heading: A Tale of Complexity - Poverty, Income and Well-being
  when: 6 PM, 20th January (Friday)
  description: <p class="simple-content">The recent Oxfam report on inequality paints a grim picture of India. It is often assumed that improving income/wages will result in a greater quality of life. The Universal Basic Income flows from the same idea. Meanwhile, there has been a shift in conceptualizing poverty in an interconnected manner, rather than in a reductive way. This begs the question whether the relationship between income/wages and well-being is linear. It is in this context, Bharath will discuss his approach in modeling the complex and dynamic relationship between income/wages and well-being, and the potential computational approaches offer in creating such models. This could lead to a better understanding of the factors that need to be addressed in designing policies to address poverty.</p><p class="simple-content">Bharath M. Palavalli designs games and simulations to understand complex adaptive systems. He is currently working on identifying and understanding the conflict prone relationship between the urban poor and the city; specifically, to help in policy design and planning in a rapidly urbanizing context of developing countries. Previously, he has designed agent based simulation frameworks, and games for safety and learning.</p>
