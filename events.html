  description: <p class="simple-content">Art + Data + Sculpture + Mathematics + Colours + Code + ...</p><p class="simple-content">At Fields of View, we are always curious about what happens when diverse perspectives have a dialogue, and if you are too, join us on April 1st. We present the first edition of Dot Cross Dab, a day-long workshop where folks from different disciplines will jam in pairs to explore what they can create together.</p><p class="simple-content">The theme for the first edition of Dot Cross Dab is 'Equity in the City'.</p><p class="simple-content">You will work in pairs. FoV will facilitate the dialogue, and at the end of the jam you come up with something. What is that something is up to you, but we insist, and that's the only thing we insist upon, is that you create something together.</p><p class="simple-content">Mail us, and tell us what your disciplinary focus is, and what's the discipline you are interested in collaborating with, and we will be in touch. If any of this doesn't make sense, mail us anyway. And let's talk.</p>
