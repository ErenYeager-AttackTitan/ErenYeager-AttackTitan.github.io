  heading: Street Vendors Act of 2014: An unfolding of contemporary history
  when: 6 PM, 5th May (Thursday)
  description: <p class="simple-content">As part of our Research in Play series, we present a talk on ‘Street Vendors Act of 2014’ by Vinay Sreenivasa of Alternative Law Forum.</p><p class="simple-content">Streets are said to be a city's vital organs, yet our cities' streets are contested spaces. There are differing views competing with each other on what should be the nature of our cities' streets, who can and should occupy them, and how they will be shaped in the future.</p><p class="simple-content">In this context, the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulating Street Vending) Act of 2014, came into effect on March 5th, 2015. The law is to both protect livelihoods and ensure regulation of vending in a democratic manner, with the involvement of the Street Vendors.</p><p class="simple-content">What are the implications of this new law? What insights does the unfolding process of implementing this law provide us? What are the issues and challenges?</p><p class="simple-content">Vinay not only has had a ringside view, but also is an active participant as someone who has been campaigning for street vendor rights much before the law came into being. On Thursday, Vinay will share with us the story of the journey thus far, and how these debates could shape the fiercely debated space that is our streets.</p><p class="simple-content">Please RSVP via twitter, facebook or email as we have limited seating at FoV.</p>
