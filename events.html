  title: Research In Play - 9
  heading: The Hybrid Domain - Collaborative Governance for Social Innovation
  when: 5 30 PM, 24th June (Friday)
  description: <p class="simple-content">As part of our Research in Play series, we present a talk on ‘Collaborative Governance for Social Innovation’ by Dr. Balaji Parthasarathy of IIIT-B.</p><p class="simple-content">To explore new possibilities to solve some of the most pressing social challenges of the 21st century, this talk will explore the hybrid domain as an emerging institutional form to generate social innovation.</p><p class="simple-content">The shifting relations between states, markets, not-for-profit sectors, and technology shape the landscape for social innovation. The empowerment of low-income populations in India in particular, and in the Global South in general, as contributors of knowledge for social innovation promises developmental impacts that earlier efforts could not deliver. Particularly in the context of state failure to deliver services that fulfill the basic needs of citizens, collaborative governance can serve as an useful alternative to blend economic and social objectives by overriding organizational boundaries which were previously considered ideologically incompatible and, therefore, unbridgeable.</p><p class="simple-content">Dr. Balaji Parthasarathy is on the faculty of the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore. His professional interests lie at the intersection of technological innovation, economic globalization, and social change, especially in underprivileged contexts.</p><p class="simple-content">Please RSVP via twitter, facebook or email as we have limited seating at FoV.</p>
