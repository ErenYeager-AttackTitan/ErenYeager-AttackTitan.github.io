  heading: <h3 class="event-heading">Geography of Industrialisation</h3>
  when: <a class="italic2">6PM, 21st January, Thursday</a>
  description: <p class="simple-content">Often, we hear that theory needs to make sense in the real world, and that practice will benefit immensely by paying attention to theory. Will the twain ever meet, make friends, and create sustainable innovations? At <span class="italic">'Research in Play'</span>, we hope to create a space where they can at the least shake hands and say hello.<p><p class="simple-content">This month, we present a talk on <span class="italic">‘Geography of Industrialisation’</span> by <span class="italic">Dr. Sharadini Rath</span>, Affiliate Fellow, Indian School of Political Economy, Pune, who has worked on various areas of urban and rural governance.</p><p class="simple-content">It is taken as a given that industrialisation and urbanisation go hand in hand.Agglomeration formations, like Chennai or Pune, have long histories of such symbiotic behaviour and are able to leverage those embedded processes in times economic upturns to register further growth, in cumulative cycles. But for India, the focus on such large agglomerations, or metros, have resulted in severe regional imbalances in the creation of industrial employment. The talk will present evidence of this for Maharashtra, and some case studies to throw light on how individual industrial locations behave over a period, and what the drivers for industrial decision making might be.</p><p class="simple-content">Please <span class="italic">RSVP</span> via twitter, facebook or email as we have limited seating.</p>
