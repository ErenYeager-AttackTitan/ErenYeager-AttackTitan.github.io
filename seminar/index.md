## About The Seminar

This seminar takes place usually on Fridays, at a suitable time and is meant for talks by early career Indian mathematicians (PhD Students, Postdocs, and young faculty members). By Indian, we mean anyone residing/working in India now or residing/working in India in the past.

You can register to be on the mailing list by filling [in this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=TMed1p1reUOCSt_owRbqYpGWPpPueOhKgz_4Mo1dioBURFVKRk1INVc0TTk4U0VXWkJBMUMyRDZPMi4u). Alternatively, you can also email me (manjil@saikia.in) or Parama Dutta (parama@gonitsora.com).

All the talks will be over Zoom. To join a talk please use the following information: ***Meeting ID 926 1140 2828*** and the Passcode is ***1729***.

## Next Talk

**On some properties of consecutive Lehmer numbers modulo a prime**

**Bidisha Roy (Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland)**

**09 April 2021 (7 pm IST)**

**Abstract**: A Lehmer number modulo a prime $p$ is an integer $a$ with $1 \leq a \leq p - 1$ whose inverse $\bar{a}$ within the same range has opposite parity. A Lehmer number  which is also a primitive root modulo $p$ is called an Lehmer primitive root (LPR).

Let $N$ be a positive integer and $p$ be an odd prime number. In this talk, we will discuss about existence of $N$-consecutive Lehmer numbers and $N$- consecutive Lehmer primitive roots in  $\left(\mathbb{Z}/ p\mathbb{Z} \right)^*$, where $p$ depends on $N$.  In the second part, we will discuss on non-primitive Lehmer numbers and their properties.

## <a name="faqs"></a>FAQs

**When does the seminar take place?**  

Usually on Fridays, the times change depending on the availability of the speaker.

**Who can attend?**  

Everyone is welcome to attend. You can register to be on the mailing list by filling [in this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=TMed1p1reUOCSt_owRbqYpGWPpPueOhKgz_4Mo1dioBURFVKRk1INVc0TTk4U0VXWkJBMUMyRDZPMi4u).

**Who can give a talk?**  

At the moment we are encouraging only PhD students, postdocs and young faculty members to give talks. If you are interested in giving a talk, please send an email to manjil@saikia.in or parama@gonitsora.com.

**Are the talks meant for a general audience?**

Yes, but this is a research seminar. We ask the speakers to spend at least 30% of their time on introduction and motivation of the topic which should be understandable for someone with a Masters level education in mathematics.

**How long is a talk?**

The talks are between 45-60 minutes, followed by discussions. We leave the discussions open ended and usually spend about 60 minutes after the talk just chatting with each other about various topics related to mathematics.

**Why was this series started?**

The primary aim was to know the different type of work being done by young mathematicians and to also look for oppurtunities for collaborative work.

**Will there be any certificate for attending?**  

No.

**Are there recordings of the talks?**

No. Only the speaker has access to recordings of their own talks. The speakers can decide to make them public if they wish to.
