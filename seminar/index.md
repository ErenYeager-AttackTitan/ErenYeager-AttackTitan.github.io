## About The Seminar

This seminar takes place usually on Fridays, at a suitable time and is meant for talks by early career Indian mathematicians (PhD Students, Postdocs, and young faculty members). By Indian, we mean anyone residing/working in India now or residing/working in India in the past.

You can register to get the Zoom links by filling [in this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=TMed1p1reUOCSt_owRbqYpGWPpPueOhKgz_4Mo1dioBURFVKRk1INVc0TTk4U0VXWkJBMUMyRDZPMi4u). Alternatively, you can also email me (manjil@saikia.in) or Parama Dutta (parama@gonitsora.com).

Check the [FAQs](#faqs).

All the talks will be over Zoom and the meeting details will be emailed to the registered participants.

## Next Talk

**On the parity of Andrews' Singular overpartition function**

**Ajit Singh (Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati)**

**11 December 2020 (8.30 pm IST)**

**Abstract**: A partition of a positive integer $n$ is any nonincreasing sequence of positive integers whose sum is $n$. The number of partitions of $n$ is denoted by $p(n)$. The partition function $p(n)$ satisfies many interesting arithmetic properties. For example, the number of partitions of $n$ into odd parts is equal to the number of partitions $n$ into distinct parts. In this talk we discuss some parity results of a special type of partition function, namely Andrews' singular overpartition. We also discuss some special spaces of Modular forms and their applications in Partition theory.

## <a name="faqs"></a>FAQs

**When does the seminar take place?**  

Usually on Fridays, the times change depending on the availability of the speaker.

**Who can attend?**  

Everyone is welcome to attend, but you have to register to get the links to attend the seminars. You can register by filling [in this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=TMed1p1reUOCSt_owRbqYpGWPpPueOhKgz_4Mo1dioBURFVKRk1INVc0TTk4U0VXWkJBMUMyRDZPMi4u).

**Who can give a talk?**  

At the moment we are encouraging only PhD students, postdocs and young faculty members either to give talks. If you are interested in giving a talk, please send an email to manjil@saikia.in or parama@gonitsora.com.

**Are the talks meant for a general audience?**

Yes, but this is a research seminar. We ask the speakers to spend at least 30% of their time on introduction and motivation of the topic which should be understandable for someone with a Masters level education in mathematics.

**How long is a talk?**

The talks are between 45-60 minutes, followed by discussions. We leave the discussions open ended and usually spend about 60 minutes after the talk just chatting with each other about various topics related to mathematics.

**Why was this series started?**

The primary aim was to know the different type of work being done by young mathematicians and to also look for oppurtunities for collaborative work.

**Will there be any certificate for attending?**  

No.

**Are there recordings of the talk?**

No. Only the speaker has access to recordings of their own talks. The speakers can decide to make them public if they wish to.
