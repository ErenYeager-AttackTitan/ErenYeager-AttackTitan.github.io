## About The Seminar

This seminar takes place usually on Fridays, at a suitable time and is meant for talks by young Assamese mathematicians (PhD Students, Postdocs, and young faculty members). If you wish to attend or give a talk in the seminar please email me (manjil@gonitsora.com) or Parama Dutta (parama@gonitsora.com).

Check the [FAQs](#faqs).

All the talks will be over Zoom and the meeting details will be emailed to the registered participants.

**An approach to construct Mathematical model through system of ordinary differential equation**

**Munmi Saikia (The Assam Royal Global University, Guwahati)**

**07 August 2020 (8 pm IST)**

**Abstract**: Mathematical modeling is an essential, emerging and indispensable tool in understanding the dynamics of a real life situation or phenomena. There are many different ways to model a problem based on the real scenario and availability of data. Differential equations can be used as a tool in construction of mathematical model of any time evolutionary process or system viz, all aspects of population problems such as growth of population, over-population, carrying capacity of an ecosystem, the effect of harvesting (such as hunting or fishing) on a population and how over-harvesting can lead to species extinction, interactions between multiple species populations, climate change, aerospace science, space technology, drug design, combat and war related problems etc. Here, an attempt to construct a mathematical model of a real life situation through differential equation has been taken. Following the formulation of the model, the feasibility and stability of all the equilibrium points are systematically analyzed and various dynamical behaviour such as local and global stability are discussed. Also, existence of Hopf bifurcation has been established. Finally, numerical simulations were carried out for clear understanding of the results.
