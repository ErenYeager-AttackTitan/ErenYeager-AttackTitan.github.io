## About The Seminar

This seminar takes place usually on Fridays, at a suitable time and is meant for talks by young Assamese mathematicians (PhD Students, Postdocs, and young faculty members). By Assamese, we mean anyone residing/working in Assam now or residing/working in Assam in the past. If you wish to attend or give a talk in the seminar please email me (manjil@gonitsora.com) or Parama Dutta (parama@gonitsora.com).

Check the [FAQs](#faqs).

All the talks will be over Zoom and the meeting details will be emailed to the registered participants.

## Next Talk

**Hard and Easy Instances of L-Tromino Tilings**

**Manjil Saikia (Cardiff University)**

**04 September 2020 (8 pm IST)**

**Abstract**: We study tilings of regions in the square lattice with L-shaped trominoes. Deciding the existence of a tiling with L-trominoes for an arbitrary region in general is NP-complete, nonetheless, we identify restrictions to the problem where it either remains NP-complete or has a polynomial time algorithm. This is based on joint work with Javier T. Akagi, Carlos F. Gaona, Fabricio Mendoza and Marcos Villagra.
