## About The Seminar

This seminar takes place usually on Fridays, at a suitable time and is meant for talks by young Assamese mathematicians (PhD Students, Postdocs, and young faculty members). By Assamese, we mean anyone residing/working in Assam now or residing/working in Assam in the past. If you wish to attend or give a talk in the seminar please email me (manjil@saikia.in) or Parama Dutta (parama@gonitsora.com).

Check the [FAQs](#faqs).

All the talks will be over Zoom and the meeting details will be emailed to the registered participants.

**Congruences for $\ell$-Regular OverPartition for $\ell\in \{5, 6, 8\}$**

**Chayanika Boruah (University of Science and Technology, Meghalaya)**

**16 October 2020 (8 pm IST)**

**Abstract**: A partition of a positive integer $n$ is a non-increasing sequence of positive integers, called parts, whose sum equals $n$. For any positive integer ${\ell}$, ${\ell}$-regular partition of a positive integer $n$ is a partition of $n$ such that none of its part is divisible by ${\ell}$. An overpartition of a positive integer $n$ is a partition of $n$ in which the first occurrence of each part can be over lined. Let $\bar{A}^\ell(n)$ denote the number of overpartitions of a non-negative integer $n$ with no part divisible by $\ell$, where $\ell$ is a positive integer. We prove, infinite family of congruences for $\bar{A}^5(n)$ modulo 4, $\bar{A}^6(n)$ modulo 3, and $\bar{A}^8(n)$ modulo 4. We also prove some other congruences.

  <summary><b>06 November, 2020</b>: On Congruent Numbers and Their Generalizations over Number Fields (<b>Shamik Das</b>, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati)</summary>

A natural number n is called a congruent number if it is the area of a right triangle with rational lengths. The classical problem of determining whether a given natural number is congruent or not is known as the congruent number problem which still remains unsolved. Here we mainly discuss two aspects of congruent number briefly. Firstly, construction of in finitely many new families, each containing infinitely many non-congruent numbers and secondly,  a criterion for a natural number to be theta-congruent over certain real number fields, where theta-congruent numbers is a generalization of congruent numbers where one considers triangles with an angle theta such that cos theta is a rational number.
