## About The Seminar

This seminar takes place usually on Fridays, at a suitable time and is meant for talks by young Assamese mathematicians (PhD Students, Postdocs, and young faculty members). By Assamese, we mean anyone residing/working in Assam now or residing/working in Assam in the past. If you wish to attend or give a talk in the seminar please email me (manjil@gonitsora.com) or Parama Dutta (parama@gonitsora.com).

Check the [FAQs](#faqs).

All the talks will be over Zoom and the meeting details will be emailed to the registered participants.

**Extremal inverse eigenvalue problems for matrices with a prescribed graph**

**Debashish Sharma (Gurucharan College, Silchar)**

**18 September 2020 (4 pm IST)**

**Abstract**: An inverse eigenvalue problem (IEP) is the problem of constructing matrices of a pre-assigned structure which also satisfy the given restrictions on eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrices or their submatrices. IEPs that require the construction of matrices having a pre-assigned pattern of zero entries are quite interesting. The pattern of zero entries of an $n\times n$ symmetric matrix determines the structure of the underlying graph on n vertices. The structure of the underlying graph has a considerable influence on the spectrum of the corresponding matrix. Such relations between the structure of a graph and the eigen structure of the corresponding matrix motivates the study of IEPs of constructing matrices described by graphs. In this talk, we discuss the inverse eigenvalue problem of constructing matrices with a prescribed graph from given eigen data consisting of the smallest and largest eigenvalues of their leading principal submatrices. In order to solve the problem, we adopt suitable schemes of labelling the vertices of a given unlabeled graph such that the characteristic polynomials of each leading principal submatrix of the matrices can be expressed by simple recurrence relations. We have obtained general results for matrices described by trees and unicyclic graphs. The method of solving provides algorithms for computing the actual entries of the required matrix. Numerical solutions of the problem are then obtained with SCILAB by feeding the eigen data and plugging in the adjacency matrix as inputs.
