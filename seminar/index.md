## About The Seminar

This seminar takes place usually on Fridays, at a suitable time and is meant for talks by young Assamese mathematicians (PhD Students, Postdocs, and young faculty members). By Assamese, we mean anyone residing/working in Assam now or residing/working in Assam in the past. If you wish to attend or give a talk in the seminar please email me (manjil@saikia.in) or Parama Dutta (parama@gonitsora.com).

Check the [FAQs](#faqs).

All the talks will be over Zoom and the meeting details will be emailed to the registered participants.

## Next Talk
