## About The Seminar

This seminar takes place usually on Fridays, at a suitable time and is meant for talks by young Assamese mathematicians (PhD Students, Postdocs, and young faculty members). If you wish to attend or give a talk in the seminar please email me (manjil@gonitsora.com) or Parama Dutta (parama@gonitsora.com).

Check the [FAQs](#faqs).

All the talks will be over Zoom and the meeting details will be emailed to the registered participants.

## Next Talk

**Combinatorics of Stammering Tableaux**

**Bishal Deb (University College London)**

**31 July 2020 (8 pm IST)**

**Abstract**: Stammering tableaux are a kind of walks on the Young lattice introduced by Josuat-Vergès in 2017. In this talk, we look at properties of stammering tableaux. Firstly, we use a link between stammering tableaux and oscillating tableaux which gives rise to a sequence of polynomials, and we describe the coefficients of these polynomials. Secondly, we describe a bijection between stammering tableaux and increasing trees, and relate this to Stirling permutations. Finally, we define a statistic on stammering tableaux called weight and show that the average weight over all stammering tableaux of a given size and shape is a polynomial in the size and shape of the stammering tableaux.

This work is part of the masters thesis of the speaker, funded by Labex Bézout at Université Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée (now Université Gustave Eiffel), and supervised by Samuele Giraudo and Matthieu Josuat-Vergès.
