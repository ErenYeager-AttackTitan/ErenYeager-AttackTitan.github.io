## About The Seminar

This seminar takes place usually on Fridays, at a suitable time and is meant for talks by young Assamese mathematicians (PhD Students, Postdocs, and young faculty members). By Assamese, we mean anyone residing/working in Assam now or residing/working in Assam in the past. If you wish to attend or give a talk in the seminar please email me (manjil@gonitsora.com) or Parama Dutta (parama@gonitsora.com).

Check the [FAQs](#faqs).

All the talks will be over Zoom and the meeting details will be emailed to the registered participants.

**Some aspects of $\Gamma_2$ graph over some of the finite commutative rings**

**Anurag Baruah (Gauhati University)**

**14 August 2020 (8 pm IST)**

**Abstract**: Among graphs associated to a ring, Zero-divisor graph holds a special place as it reveals interesting relations between ring theory and graph theory. After the concept of zero-divisor graph was introduced by Beck in 1988, Anderson and Livingston modified this definition of zero divisor graph in 1999 by restricting the vertices to the non-zero zero divisors of the ring $R$. In 2008, Anderson and Badawi introduced the total graph $\Gamma (R)$ of a commutative ring $R$. Motivated by the significant results obtained from the structure of $\Gamma (R)$, Sengupta introduced a new type of graph over rings, involving both the operations of a ring in the adjacency conditions. Let $R$ be a ring then $\Gamma_2$ is an undirected graph $(V,E)$ in which $V = R \setminus \{0\}$ and for any $a, b \in V$, $ab \in E$ if and only if $a \neq b$ and either $a\cdot b = 0$ or $b \cdot a = 0$ or $a + b$ is a zero-divisor (including $0$). Here the general structure of this graph is dicussed for some of the finite commutative rings and other properties like connectedness, diameter, girth, chromatic number, completeness, eulerianity and planarity of these graphs are also determined.
