## About The Seminar

This seminar takes place usually on Fridays, at a suitable time and is meant for talks by young Assamese mathematicians (PhD Students, Postdocs, and young faculty members). If you wish to attend or give a talk in the seminar please email me (manjil@gonitsora.com) or Parama Dutta (parama@gonitsora.com).

Check the [FAQs](#faqs).

All the talks will be over Zoom and the meeting details will be emailed to the registered participants.

## Next Talk

**Families of Congruences for Fractional Partition Functions Modulo Powers of Primes**

**Hirakjyoti Das (Tezpur University)**

**17 July 2020 (5 pm IST)**

**Abstract**: Recently, Chan and Wang (Fractional powers of the generating function for the partition function. Acta Arith. 187(1), 59--80 (2019)) studied the fractional powers of the generating function for the partition function and found several congruences satisfied by the corresponding coefficients. In this talk, we find some new families of congruences modulo powers of primes. We also find analogous results for the coefficients of the fractional powers of the generating function for the 2-color partition function.
