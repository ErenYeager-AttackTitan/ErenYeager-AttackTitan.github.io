<p>The dashboard is built by Excel with features <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576">Pivot Table</a>, <strong>Pivot Chart</strong> and <strong>Silcer</strong>.</p>

<p>The funny parts of this dashboard is that you can get what youâ€™d like to see by apply <strong>filters</strong> at the bottom. All charts will be changed as soon as you <strong>click specfic buttons</strong>.</p>

<p>The data is only include 2000 rows and it slow down my Excel when make changes, especially formats and layouts. For data with more rows/record, maybe Python or R is a better choice to build such a dashboard.</p>

<p>Related data are sample data from online.</p>
