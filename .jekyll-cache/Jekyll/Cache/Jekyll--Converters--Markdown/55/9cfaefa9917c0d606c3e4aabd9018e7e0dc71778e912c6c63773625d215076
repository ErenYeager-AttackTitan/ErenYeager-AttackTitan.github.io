<p>The dashboard is built by Excel with features <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivottable-to-analyze-worksheet-data-a9a84538-bfe9-40a9-a8e9-f99134456576">Pivot Table</a>, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-pivotchart-c1b1e057-6990-4c38-b52b-8255538e7b1c">Pivot Chart</a> and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-slicers-to-filter-data-249f966b-a9d5-4b0f-b31a-12651785d29d">Slicer</a>.</p>

<p>The funny parts of this dashboard is that you can get what youâ€™d like to see by apply <strong>filters</strong> at the bottom. All charts will be changed as long as you <strong>click specfic buttons</strong>.</p>

<p>The data only includes 2000 rows and it slow down my Excel when making changes, especially formats and layouts. For data with more rows/records, <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> or <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a> is probably a better choice to build such a dashboard.</p>
