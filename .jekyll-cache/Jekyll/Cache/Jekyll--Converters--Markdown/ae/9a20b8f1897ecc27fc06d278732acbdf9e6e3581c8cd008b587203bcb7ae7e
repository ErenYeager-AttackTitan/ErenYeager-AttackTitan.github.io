I"Î<p>Hi, my name is Tao and I am looking for data/business analyst position currently. I hold a Bechelorâ€™s degree in mathematics (Information and Computing Science with data analysis track, Wuhan University of Technology) and a Masterâ€™s degree in science (Business Analytics, University of Exeter).
Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles. So thatâ€™s how I look at data sets: they are big puzzles and once they are been solved, you will get rewards in business. Finding secrets nobody else sees is the challenge to me.
Before I studied my postgradute degree, I had worked for one year as a marketing analyst. I have worked for 5 companies and orgnisations which gives me the ability to translate complex questions into understand insights.
