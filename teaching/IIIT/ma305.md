# Information

**Instructor**: Dr Manjil Pratim Saikia

**Contact**: manjil@iiitmanipur.ac.in (please only use this email address to send me emails related to this course)

**Lecture Time & Place**: 


**Office Hours**:

**Course Prerequisites**: It will be assumed that students are familiar with the following courses: [MA101](/teaching/IIIT/ma1011), MA203, CS101, CS201 and CS301.

**Attendance Policy**: Attendance is mandatory, institute policy is minimum 75% continous attendance failing which the student is not allowed to sit in exams. If you have a genuine reason for missing the lectures please talk to me or the HoD as soon as possible (*talking just a few weeks before the exam will not be sufficient*).

# Course Details

Linear programming problem: formulation and geometric ideas, simplex algorithm, duality, transportation and assignment problem, Integer programming problems; Nonlinear optimization: method of Lagrange multipliers, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theory, numerical methods for nonlinear optimization; Convex optimization and quadratic programming; Applications of linear, integer and quadratic programming to various areas of science and engineering.

# Reading Materials

There is no real textbook for this course. I will be using my own notes. 

Each week **two** students will be in charge of transscribing the lectures for that week. This should be done in LaTeX using the template available [here](/teaching/IIIT/MA305/template.tex), you should use this [style file](/teaching/IIIT/MA305/template.sty) and [bib file](/teaching/IIIT/MA305/template.bib) when required. All figures must be in pdf format (check [Ipe](https://ipe.otfried.org/) for instance). The output should look something [like this](/teaching/IIIT/MA305/template.pdf). The transcribing will earn you your marks for Assessment III and if a particularly good job is done then the lowest problem sheet score will be dropped form the final calculation.
