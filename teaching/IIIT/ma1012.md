# Course Details

**Multivariable Calculus**: Vector functions of one variable â€“ continuity, differentiation and integration; functions
of several variables - continuity, partial derivatives, directional derivatives, gradient, differentiability, chain rule;
tangent planes and normals, maxima and minima, Lagrange multiplier method; repeated and multiple integrals
with applications to volume, surface area, moments of inertia, change of variables; vector fields, line and surface
integrals; Green's, Gauss's and Stokes' theorems and their applications.

**Ordinary Differential Equations**: First order differential equations - exact differential equations, integrating
factors, Bernoulli equations, existence and uniqueness theorem, applications; higher-order linear differential
equations - solutions of homogeneous and non-homogeneous equations, method of variation of parameters,
series solutions of linear differential equations, Legendre equation and Legendre polynomials, Bessel equation
and Bessel functions of first and second kinds. Laplace and inverse Laplace transforms; properties, convolutions;
solution of ODE by Laplace transform. Systems of first-order equations, two-dimensional linear autonomous
system, phase plane, critical points, stability.

# Reading Materials

**Textbook**: The recommended textbook for the first part of the course is **A Course in Multivariable Calculus and Analysis** by *Sudhir R. Ghorpade and Balmohan V. Limaye* (Springer, 2019 printing). The recommended textbook for the second part of the course is **Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes** (third edition) by *George F. Simmons* (CRC Press, 2017). I will supplement some of the topics with my own notes.
