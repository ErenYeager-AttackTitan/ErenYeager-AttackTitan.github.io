# Information

**Instructor**: Dr Manjil Pratim Saikia

**Lecture Time & Place**: 

Section B (M 1500-1555, T 1200-1255, W 1200-1255, Th 1100-1155) in Room 7

Section D (T 1500-1555, W 1500-1555, Th 1500-1555, F 0900-0955) in Room 4

**Office Hours**: T 1700-1800 and Th 1700-1800 in Faculty Block - II, Office F-7 (*Also by appointment.*)

**Attendance Policy**: Attendance is mandatory, institute policy is minimum 75% continous attendance failing which the student is not allowed to sit in exams. If you have a genuine reason for missing the lectures please talk to me or the HoD as soon as possible (*talking just a few weeks before the exam will not be sufficient*).

# Course Details

**Linear Algebra**: Systems of linear equations and their solutions; vector space Rn and its subspaces; spanning set and linear independence; matrices, inverse and determinant; range space and rank, null space and nullity, eigenvalues and eigenvectors; diagonalization of matrices; similarity; inner product, Gram-Schmidt process; vector spaces (over the field of real and complex numbers), linear transformations.

**Single Variable Calculus**: Convergence of sequences and series of real numbers; continuity of functions; differentiability, Rolle's theorem, mean value theorem, Taylor's theorem; power series; Riemann integration, fundamental theorem of calculus, improper integrals; application to length, area, volume and surface area of revolution.

# Reading Materials

The recommended textbook for the first part is **Linear Algebra and its Applications (Fourth Edition)** by *Gilbert Strang* (Wellesley- Cambridge
Press, 2009). This book is available in the institute library, a cheap Indian edition is also available to buy online. In addition, Strang's webpage (link [here](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/)) has a treasure trove of video lectures and lecture notes on first year undergraduate linear algebra that he has taught for many years at MIT. He also has a very [popular OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) which is also worth watching.

Class notes, problem sheets, quizzes and exams will be uploaded here as the course progresses.
