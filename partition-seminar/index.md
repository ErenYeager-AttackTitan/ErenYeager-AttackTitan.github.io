## About The Seminar

This is a research seminar initiated by me and some of my collaborators who are interested in topics related to partitions and $q$-series. We plan to meet every two weeks.  

If you are interested in attending the seminar or giving a talk, please write to me at **manjil@gonitsora.com** and I will add you to our mailing list.  

The talks are not recorded, they are meant to be for informal discussions with the speaker(s) and everyone is encouraged to ask questions.
